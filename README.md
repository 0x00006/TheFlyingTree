This is a private community that seeks to emulate a very filtered and curated microcosm of the Reddit experience. People are picked based on their participation on a wide variety of subreddits, and can post almost anything (within the scope of the rules).

In order to keep such a small community active, we have a weekly "culling", in which inactive users are kicked out of the subreddit. Once you survive your first culling, you get a numbered flair, till then you are an "Initiate". Posts or comments count as activity.

Join our discord server: {{Redacted}}.

Reddit sitewide rules and TOS still apply, and we have 5 rules that must be followed:-

    Nothing too NSFW.

    No bigotry or harassment will be tolerated.

    Do not post personal information.

    No low-effort, circlejerk, or shitposts.

    No idiocy. (Not to worry, you will be asked to explain yourself before any action is taken.)

I swear 50% of the posts I've seen in the last week or two from this sub are either trying to figure out exactly how the bot selects people or speculating on the sub being a codified social experiment of some kind.

If the sub creator wanted to be transparent about the bot they would. And I see no reason to doubt the motives outlined in the sidebar: make a little mini reddit. Sure, it's an "experiment" to set certain rules of recruitment and dismissal and see how things evolve, but that doesn't mean there's a point per se beyond entertainment, which frankly describes most of what humans do that isn't necessary for survival.

It is what it is and we're given a lot of freedom here, make it what you want it to be. Personally I do NOT want it to be an endless meta circlejerk but if that's what y'all wanna talk about I might be out. If most of the ranked users feel as I do and think this phenomenon is mostly driven by the new crop of initiates every week, I guess I'm opening a discussion here on how we can limit the dilution of other content.
