I think this is some kind of experiment but I don't mind to participate. I don't understand what the name means but that's ok. I am making this my diary.\n\nI'm a transgender boy. I'm annoyed about not being able to transition yet and being too old for hormone blockers. My family is supportive but my mom thinks hormones are dangerous. I got a form so my name can be changed in the school system and my mom hesitated a bit to sign it but she did. Give it a few days and I'll have the right name on the roster. Nothing hurts me worse than when I respond to my deadname. Yesterday a teacher who called me the right name every day until now called me my deadname and I responded to it and it just hurts. School also sucks because of gym class. I have aerobic walking because I wear a chest binder and can't do heavy exercise in it. We have to dress out for aerobic walking. I think it's stupid because all we do is walk. So I have to go into a women's locker room to dress out for aerobic walking. It ruins my day every day. I feel like a fox in a hen house. I don't belong in there. I'm not a girl. I just want them to see me as a boy. Once I get a job I'm going to use my first paychecks to change my name legally. Then going to the doctor and getting my medicine won't be as bad. My grandma is going to hate me when she finds out. I'll say I don't care what she thinks but I probably will. I can't stand being hated. \nThanks for reading,\nRonnie", "score": 39, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/ph3g5x/ive_been_added_to_a_place_where_i_can_say_roughly/", "id": "ph3g5x", "author": "RonnieMyBoy", "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "num_comments": 80, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630669142.0, "comments": [{"author": "Munnin41", "id": "hbfpn1z", "score": 12, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #298", "submission": "ph3g5x", "stickied": false, "body": "I'm not trans, so I don't really know.

Hang in there for the tough times. The good news is that the world is slowly becoming more trans-friendly. But, the process will be slow for many to accept and to be willing to try to understand. \n\nEventually, change will lead to more simplified ways to accommodate trans people. Earlier I was triaging a trans male at the clinic I work at. He asked me to have his name updated in his medical records to his preferred name. The problem is that we have to have the name that matches his ID and his insurance. So we have added a note on his chart for gender identity and his preferred name. But, this note won't be visible from all of the different sections in his chart so if we call with lab results we may still use the wrong name or pronoun.\n\nOn top of that, in medicine we have to treat the entire person. So, I still have to ask gender specific questions as they can relate to other issues. In addition we can't assume sexual orientation of a trans person when getting information from the patient. \n\nSo what I am trying to say is that things are complicated now and many of us want to be as accommodating as we can. Try to be patient with those of us who put you in uncomfortable situations when we absolutely mean no harm. \n\nIn time you will find more and more people to keep in your inner circle who love and appreciate you for who you are.
