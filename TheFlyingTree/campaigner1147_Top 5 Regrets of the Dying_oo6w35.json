{"title": "Top 5 Regrets of the Dying", "name": "t3_oo6w35", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/oo6w35/top_5_regrets_of_the_dying/", "selftext": "Another post on here had me reminiscing about the years I spent volunteering at hospice centers and taking care of the elderly. That lead me to look up this list again and read it. Whenever I\u2019m feeling \u201coff\u201d in my life or misaligned, I like to sit with myself and usually a journal and go through where my priorities are/where I am inappropriately spending my most valuable resources: time and energy. Usually calling to mind this list and other things that I think truly matter to me now and will ALSO truly matter to me on my deathbed, helps me repriortize where I am spending my time and energy. \n\n\n1. I wish I\u2019d had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.\n\n2. I wish I hadn\u2019t worked so hard.\n\n3. I wish I\u2019d had the courage to express my feelings.\n\n4. I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends.\n\n5. I wish that I had let myself be happier.\n\n\nWhat do you think of this list? What does it make you think about? How does it make you feel? Is there anything you are surprised to see? Anything you would add?\n\nTwo things are coming up for me right now: \n\n1) I haven\u2019t looked into if these are regrets of the dying universally or just regionally which leads me to wonder if the \u201cworking so hard\u201d regret is more prevalent in America/western culture where IMO we as a society over emphasize the importance of careers and often explicitly and implicitly promote the message that happiness equals success determined by the amount of one\u2019s material prosperity. Not to mention the damage that can occur from people defining themselves and their self-worth by their careers. \n\n2) In regards to the last one\u2026 Why do we not allow ourselves to be happier? Do we self sabotage a lot? Is it because we focus too much on the past and are depressed and we focus too much on the future and are anxious?What else gets in the way? What do we do to not allow ourselves to be happy?\n\nEdit to add source: \nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/kathycaprino/2019/12/13/the-top-regrets-of-the-dying-and-what-we-need-to-learn-from-them/?sh=5deb0cdb7ce7", "score": 29, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/oo6w35/top_5_regrets_of_the_dying/", "id": "oo6w35", "author": "campaigner1147", "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "num_comments": 40, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1626802542.0, "comments": [{"author": "shig23", "id": "h5wuhf3", "score": 8, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Druid #5", "submission": "oo6w35", "stickied": false, "body": "I wonder how much age affects those priorities.
