Mix in chocolate chips of your choice (you can experiment on these peanut butter flavoured, caramel flavoured etc). Chill overnight and then bake according to package directions. Then just add the kisses and additional chocolate chips when they're still warm enough for them to stick to the cookie. For all the thumbprints, what I did was to press a bottle cap in the middle of the raw cookie dough before popping them in the oven, but if they still rise then just press the middle part down again once they're done baking and that should be fine.\n\nFor the choco chip ones, I used a recipe from Sally's Baking Addiction, here's a link https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/chewy-chocolate-chip-cookies/\nBut I found it that I prefer adding a tad less baking soda. Aside from that I followed the recipe but divided that dough by three so I could have a choco chip flavoured one, a plain one for the thumbprints and one for peanut butter flavoured ones. It says to put them in the fridge overnight, so I did. Bake 'em accordinf to the recipe then add whatever choco chipa you'd like when they're still warm for them to stick.\n\nAside from the recipe I linked, everything else was not measured and had to go by instinct. Chaotic, I know! You should've seen my workstation during and after the baking process.
