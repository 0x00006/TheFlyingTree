And a very high number of people in science, especially STEM, have social deficiencies. While they only deal with their narrow field, that's not much of a problem (unless they advise students). Putting these people into positions where they have to lead people on a large scale, without vetting them out would end in a disaster. \n\nBut how do you know whether someone would not just go full Mengele in order to fix, let's say, climate change? Well, there are psychological tests for this. But these tests all rely on that the tested person does not know what he is being tested for or does not care about it. If he knows and cares, these tests can be easily subverted and will give any outcome the person desires. And this becomes easier the more intelligent the tested person is.\n\nYes, I know that the current political system prefers liars and narcissists. With the US being a particularly skewed system towards narcissism and one of the most extreme cases in the world (i.e. most countries are nowhere nearly as bad). Thus I can understand the need to look for a different system that is better for the volont\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, but bouncing from one extreme to the other, as the US does so often, is not the way how to solve this issue.\n\nFor the US, I would suggest abolishing the two party system. Having multiple parties, where none has the absolute majority, will over time fix the abnormal us-vs-them mentality that is so rampant in US politics in a few (political) generations. Another aspect that needs to be fixed is that all states think they are exceptional (ok, it's not just the states, but the people themselves, on all levels). There is a need that the whole country talks to each other. The problems most people face are the same, independent where they live, yet everyone thinks that their case or their state is special and the federal government is evil.
