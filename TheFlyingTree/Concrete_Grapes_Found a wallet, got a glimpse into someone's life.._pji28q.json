I was driving down the interstate, as one does, at 75mph, out in rural nowhere, chatting to my passenger. When, out of the corner of my eye i see something on the side of the interstate that clicks in my brain--'wallet' It was standing up on its edges, and i SLAM on the brakes and pull over, and wait for THE car go go past me, and back up a few hundred feet to this thing i THINK is a wallet.   \n\n\nIt was.   \n\n\nWhen i get home i become determined to find him. I cant pronounce his name. He is, as far as i can discern, from India. He's newly married. He works in IT--his work ID is in there, his store memberships are in there, his health insurance, more than a half dozen credit cards--some clearly very high end. His' wife's ID, from a club they're both in.   \n\n\nHe seems like a man with all of his ducks in a row. His shit together. There's no phone numbers, and everything in the wallet with a number that might have his is closed today. So i google him.   \n\n\nThe results were awe inspiring. He's 28, hes FUCKING BRILLIANT. His education is second to none. I cant find a phone number. Damn. Nothing. I can see he bought a house on google--this shit's creepy. He paid 950k for it. It's gorgeous.   \n\n\nI googled his wife, and it was a little easier to find something on her. I called her University. They called her for me, and put me on the line with her, they were still on the road, but now 100 miles away. They had pulled over to worry about the wallet. That i found that thing AT ALL, let alone within an hour and a half of him losing it, is wild. They almost turned around, but it was pretty late.   \n\n\nI can only imagine what kind of worrying and talk they were having when her phone rings, and it's her fucking university, that she graduated from 3 years ago. Like--what? And then someone asks about the wallet they're talking about. I imagine it was surreal. When we were connected, she was stunned. They both sound like sweet people. That they live in a big city and make a LOT of money was pretty obvious when she started talking about mailing services--where i live, there's a really shitty post office. The kind where it's so old and so forgotten, that maybe the woman working there only keeps the job because of a glitch in the system hasnt close the office yet. They still use the paper sliding graphite paper thing if you try to pay with a credit card. I shit you not.   \n\n\nAnyway, gonna send it to them, no biggy.   \n\n\nBut man, seeing that young man, and how WELL he's put together his life, and his wife, and how astoundingly well she's done as well...   \n\n\nMade me realize they're going to make more in an single year than i'll make my entire life... and ... it's a little strange. I'm happy--but, wow, i sure didnt do the right things in life.   \n\n\nAnyway. Peak into someone's life multiple income brackets above mine was weird.", "score": 30, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/pji28q/found_a_wallet_got_a_glimpse_into_someones_life/", "id": "pji28q", "author": "Concrete_Grapes", "link_flair_text": "Fascinating", "num_comments": 17, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630998838.0, "comments": [{"author": "ShaBa42", "id": "hbwmgya", "score": 10, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Initiate", "submission": "pji28q", "stickied": false, "body": "Everybody give me your wallet.
