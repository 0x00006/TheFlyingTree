I was thrilled since I had stupidly opened the box before realizing it was the S20 5G instead of the S20 UW.\n\n> to be honest im not even really clear on what the 5g is or does, i just assumed it was an upgrade from 4g\n\nYeah. It's much faster. It requires new hardware in the phone, especially the antenna, I think. I have heard that it also interferes somewhat with NOAA's ability to use radar and forecast the weather, which is kind of important.\n\nhttps://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/09/200924082706.htm\n\n> though im sure theres more involved then just a simple upgrade.\n\nIt's simple for us. We just throw money at buying a new device. Mine needed to be replaced anyway due to the problems I mentioned. So, it seemed silly to buy a phone that couldn't do 5G.\n\nI'm on Verizon. So, it makes sense to be on their latest network with a new device.\n\nBut, there are 2 different 5Gs. The 5G that is going around the country nationally requires fewer cell towers transmitting. The one in cities requires more towers but is even faster and better. It's just too hard to roll out that many towers in less densely populated areas.\n\nEither phone would work in both locations. But, having a phone that can specifically make use of the ultrawide band in cities makes sense if you live in a city. New York is one of the early cities to get the ultrawide. So, I wanted that.\n\n> im on sprint so ive been more focused on the merger with tmobile (or i guess rather absorption) and trying to balance changing the phone with that, more of a pain in the ass then youd think.\n\nI'm not at all surprised that's a pain in the ass.\n\nI love this quote:\n\n> *\u201cI have always wished for my computer to be as easy to use as my telephone; my wish has come true because I can no longer figure out how to use my telephone.\u201d* \u2015 Bjarne Stroustrup (creator of the C++ programming language)\n\nI believe he said this sometime in the early days of cell phones or possibly the early smart phones.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628342636.0, "parent_id": "t1_h80i8hc", "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}, {"author": "Bexpert5", "id": "h7zzfyz", "score": 13, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #162", "submission": "ozi9gd", "stickied": false, "body": "Got my drivers license", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628294923.0, "parent_id": "t3_ozi9gd", "replies": [{"author": "MisanthropicScott", "id": "h80a0k0", "score": 3, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Druid #6 | Ordo Cognitus", "submission": "ozi9gd", "stickied": false, "body": "Congrats!", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628300754.0, "parent_id": "t1_h7zzfyz", "replies": []}]}, {"author": "MisanthropicScott", "id": "h809yxa", "score": 4, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Druid #6 | Ordo Cognitus", "submission": "ozi9gd", "stickied": false, "body": "The cute little northern watersnake who swam by our canoe yesterday without being at all nervous.
