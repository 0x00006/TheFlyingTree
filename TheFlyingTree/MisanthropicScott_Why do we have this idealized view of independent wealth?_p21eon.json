Wealth, whether we like it or not, often makes people who have it feel as if there is something inherently (heh, pun) better about them because they have it. If they feel as if they're our 'betters' they seek political power and use their wealth to secure it.   \n\n\nWe tend to look down on it because it represents the reason why we became a democratic republic in the first place, to throw off the aristocracy and power of generational wealth that was part of those old systems. It's a breeding ground for nepotism and dictatorships.   \n\n\nOne could look at the problem with wealth, and Americas disdain for it when we dig deeper into politics, and how, even though they get elected (because wealth), many Americans DREAD thinking of having another Bush as president, or feel the taint of the Kennedy family and it's sort of 'American royalty' thing they have going on.   \n\n\nIt's the revulsion towards aristocracy that makes many Americans disrespect dependent wealth. It's a sign that, there's going to be, without question, a resulting imbalance in power in our democracy if it keeps up.   \n\n\nWe DO love wealth that was well earned--even if sometimes we hate how much of it's earned--because it shows that there's a COUNTER to established dependent wealth, and that's 'new money'--old money is the group that often spends vast sums to make sure new money has as many problems and hurdles as possible. It's no accident that Bezos and Zuckerberg are constantly harrassed and pulled in front of congress to answer dumb questions. Old money, dependent wealth, is trying to put the new comers in their place--to show them they're NOT more powerful just because they got rich, and ... they better never forget it.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628643317.0, "parent_id": "t3_p21eon", "replies": [{"author": "MisanthropicScott", "id": "h8hcj44", "score": 5, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Druid #6 | Ordo Cognitus", "submission": "p21eon", "stickied": false, "body": "Good points.
