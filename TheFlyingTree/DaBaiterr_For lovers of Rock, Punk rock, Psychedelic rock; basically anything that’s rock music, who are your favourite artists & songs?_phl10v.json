Bad Brains, one of the best 80s hardcore bands, were a Black Punk band who found more success than Death did, although their career was always chaotic. Bad Brains mixed reggae songs among the thrashers. Bad Brains *Live* (1988) is a good starting point.  \n  \n\"Rock the Casbah\" is one of your top songs. Have you listened to a lot from The Clash? There's a compilation I like called *Super Black Market Clash* that includes a remix of \"Rock the Casbah\" called \"Mustapha Dance.\" If you want to listen to more from The Clash, *London Calling*, or *The Clash* are good albums to start with. You have to decide that you really like this band before you want to put on *Sandinista*, trust me.  \n  \nHere Lies Man is a modern band that plays rock riffs over African rhythms. You like Talking Heads and Black Sabbath. I think you might go for Here Lies Man.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630804181.0, "parent_id": "t3_phl10v", "replies": []}, {"author": "francostine", "id": "hbjaeiq", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #593", "submission": "phl10v", "stickied": false, "body": "Erra\n\nFit for a king\n\nMemphis may fire\n\nAugust burns red\n\nPalisades", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630731449.0, "parent_id": "t3_phl10v", "replies": []}, {"author": "CorpseJuiceSlurpee", "id": "hbjas4z", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #434", "submission": "phl10v", "stickied": false, "body": "The Dwarves", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630731698.0, "parent_id": "t3_phl10v", "replies": []}, {"author": "PowerPoint_2077", "id": "hbjavol", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #498", "submission": "phl10v", "stickied": false, "body": "I DONT KNOW HOW BUT THEY FOUND ME\nSiames\nThe Orion Experience \n(I\u2019m not that big of a rock music enthusiast, but I think these three count)", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630731764.0, "parent_id": "t3_phl10v", "replies": []}, {"author": "datsLex", "id": "hbjbhn4", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #587", "submission": "phl10v", "stickied": false, "body": "Stoned Jesus - I'm the Mountain", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630732176.0, "parent_id": "t3_phl10v", "replies": []}, {"author": "kleenexhotdogs", "id": "hbjcl2v", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #284", "submission": "phl10v", "stickied": false, "body": "Pop punk count?
