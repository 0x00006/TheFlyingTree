I see some kind of shadow figure that's unrecognizable enter the room and stand at the foot of the bed, looking over us sleeping. It didn't feel good. The next thing I'm suddenly wide awake laying in bed, with my torso suddenly and completely upright, and I'm screaming bloody death. The screaming was so hard it felt as if my body was putting everything it had into that one thing. I screamed so hard my throat was sore for days. I screamed so loud that we were worried what our neighbors would think. I screamed so loud, I could feel it in my core the next day. It was a weird experience.\n\nThe screaming of course wakes up my sleeping partner, but we're both reasonable about it, decide it was just a bad dream and go back to sleep pretty quickly. Nothing like this has ever happened to me before, or ever since.\n\nThe next morning I'm trying to describe how I felt when this was happening, and I started by describing being alerted to seeing some figure in the room. There was a sound, something that made a knock, or a light bang, and that awakened me to seeing this figure. My partner asked what it sounded like, and I said \"well it's kind of like a knocking sound or a ...\"\n\nJust as I'm saying this, there's a bang against the window behind the head of the bed, and we're both startled for a moment when I look over and say \n\"That. \nThat's what it sounded like, just before I see the dark figure.\"\n\nSo we go outside to see what happened, and we find a small bird, whats probably a grey Sparrow, must have flown into the window. Now it lays there on the ground dead. Never had a bird fly into the window before, or ever since, it's only the third floor of a house surrounded by other houses the same height.", "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/p7dfkz/the_spookiest_thing_thats_ever_happened_to_me/", "id": "p7dfkz", "author": "ryguyt", "link_flair_text": "Fascinating", "num_comments": 8, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629374454.0, "comments": [{"author": "FnchWzrd314", "id": "h9j0fk0", "score": 3, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #53 | Ordo Cognitus", "submission": "p7dfkz", "stickied": false, "body": "I'm no expert, but that reminds me of descriptions of sleep paralysis, super creepy though, especially the bird thing.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629378044.0, "parent_id": "t3_p7dfkz", "replies": [{"author": "ryguyt", "id": "h9j1zj9", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #99", "submission": "p7dfkz", "stickied": false, "body": "Yeah totally sleep paralysis and definitely a dream, not spooky action.
