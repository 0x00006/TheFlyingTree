In \u201cliquid\u201d modernity, people live uprooted, always in motion, always looking for new sensory experiences, trained in a constant positive attitude even at work.  But for this very reason they are easier to stress.  Life coaches, mindfulness gurus, self-help books and sometimes psychotherapy itself constitute the paraphernalia with which people encounter this \"culture of acceleration\": introspection, continuous learning, positive thinking are some of the mantras of this philosophy of success and constant improvement, in personal life as well as at work.  If we are unhappy or stressed, in short, it is also this fault of capitalism.\n \n  B.mann's is an effective self-help against self-help that intends to re-evaluate which, in his opinion, we often tend to put aside the value of negative emotions, such as melancholy or sadness, or life quiet, opposed to the obsessive search for the new.  We can read it, if we want, as a philosophy of laziness: there is nothing wrong if for once we give up an experience to sit in slippers and watch a TV series.  But Brinkmann, who refers to the stoicism of Seneca and Marcus Aurelius, sees it as rather the reconquest of an inner stability from which a greater awareness of one's limitations should arise, as well as greater attention to our moral responsibilities towards others.", "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/pf696t/a_selfhelp_critique_to_selfhelp_mechanisms/", "id": "pf696t", "author": "10000x100", "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "num_comments": 5, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630417827.0, "comments": [{"author": "PalatableNourishment", "id": "hb2boxq", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #53", "submission": "pf696t", "stickied": false, "body": "Society also has a problem with consumption.
