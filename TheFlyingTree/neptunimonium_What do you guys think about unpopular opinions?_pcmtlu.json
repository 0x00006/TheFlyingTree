Trump should have this.  Trump should have that.  If Fox News hadn't condoned such and such, people wouldn't believe such lunatic nonsense today.\n\nThat's the A and B, so to say.  It's not wrong.  But it ignores the massively misguided policies of political leaders very far removed from Donald Trump.  It ignores the precious weeks and weeks in which \"liberal\" press organs told their audience that Covid wasn't anything to worry about, or would mock those (very few) places that reacted early and decisively to prepare for the pandemic.\n\nAnd speaking of which, it ignores the reality of vastly disparate outcomes.  Where I live, it would be wrong to say that Covid has passed us by entirely, but let's say we have had a completely different experience of the pandemic, because we were one of those early and decisive places.  A metropolitan area of 9 million, and while 50,000 people were dying in New York City we had no more than a few hundred deaths.\n\nBut we are invisible in the discourse.  No one will talk about why that is.  (Or they find excuses, or change the subject.)  And, they never will.  The \"consensus reality\" when all is said and done will completely ignore that we didn't experience the kinds of meltdowns that so much of the rest of the country experienced.  That can't be accepted, because the consensual delusion -- the myth that, in my opinion, is scarcely less irresponsible than that of the anti-vax nutcases -- is that \"it was the same everywhere and there was nothing anyone could have done differently.\"\n\nNo one is ever going to hold their own mayors or governors responsible for their reckless decisions.  Heaven knows they will *never* ever look at their own town and local governments -- which is by the way the only level at which Covid response in the US ever mattered -- and all forbid they ever question or reflect on themselves.  Even now many of them are sending their own children to school, rationalizing away, with their favorite news organs helping them along, while the pandemic is still unfolding.\n\nYes, the ones that are vaccinated are going to do much better than the ones who aren't, thank heavens.
