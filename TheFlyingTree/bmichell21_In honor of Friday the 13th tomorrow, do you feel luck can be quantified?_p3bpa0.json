It's clear we should disregard and completely detach the concept of luck(and bad luck) from cultural artifacts of our ignorant ancestors.\n\nCan good happenstance, like winning the lottery, be quantified?  Can bad happenstance, like suffering from disease, be quantified? Yes, all you need to do to admit this in principle is just to admit that there *are* good and bad things. This is surprisingly easy to do, but you wouldn't know it if you just asked lots of people, because people can be wrong in very complex ways(this gets worse the more intelligence rises), and this problem is famous in ethics, where you can find a smart person saying: \"But is it *really* wrong to torture an innocent child's feet with a blowtorch maximally, for something as trivial as one's sadistic pleasure?\" This can *seem* like an enlightened question because it's open to skepticism and denies all intuitions.\n\nIt's not an enlightened question, because yes, it is really wrong to do that. If words like \"wrong\" mean anything, then that's precisely what \"wrong\" means. This relates to \"bad\". If you were the person tortured, rather than this child, this would be bad. Not just for you. Not just subjectively, but as an objective description of how conscious beings process torture. This is what ethics **is**-- it's a description of the way conscious agents interact with each other and the world in terms of suffering/wellbeing. Ethics is not... whether pie or cake tastes better, or something. Again, words really do have meaning, and their truth propositions really do cohere(or really do fail to cohere) to reality in a way that isn't merely subjective, identical to \"2+2=4\".\n\nRegardless of this, all you need to do is set the parameters for good and bad, and then find good and bad in the world, and then measure on how much good and bad you find in peoples lives.(Hint: People languishing in the torture of the worst poverty and war zones on Earth are generally experiencing \"bad\"-- people who are having the time of their lives on a yacht in pristine waters, enjoying luxury food, friendship, sex, status, and so on, are generally experiencing \"good\").\n\nFrom here, one final step is one only needs to admit that these circumstances are founded purely in luck(or the absence of it). Why luck? Because you don't freely choose a single variable that decides if one finds themselves in poverty or high social class. You don't freely choose:\n\n* Genes\n* Parents\n* Environment one was born into\n* Peer groups\n* Personality\n* Neurons firing, therefore which thoughts arise\n\nAnd so on.\n\nOnly a confusion somewhere here (either a) A failure to admit that good and bad are real ideas or b) a failure to admit that we're simply thrown into gradations of luck/bad luck), causes us to fail to understand that luck and bad luck are quantifiable. There's by *definition* a luckiest person alive right now, in a large number of senses-- lucky because they benefit in one sense, another person could be the luckiest in another sense, but all of this reduces to a kind of meaning that really is real-- it would be dishonest to say a paraplegic in the slums of Mumbai who begs for death every day is \"lucky\"-- we'd need to be dishonest to make this point, even if a *technical* point exists(ie-- this person was \"lucky\" because they received 1,000 Rupees from a stranger(10-15 dollars).
