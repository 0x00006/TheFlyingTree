If a miracle seems too good to be true and defies science, it probably didn't happen. Being passed down through a religion or tradition also doesn't help. We now have such a good understanding of how the world works on the normal everyday scale that if a phenomenon defies physics of the everyday level, then it almost certainly didn't happen. Of course there are still gaps in science, most notably on the cosmological and quantum scales, but those scales don't influence the everyday scale in such a way as to make many miracles possible. Turning water to wine, for example. We have such a good understanding of physics that we can safely say that this didn't happen.\n\nI'm not saying the scientific theories we have now are the be all end all of all explanations.
