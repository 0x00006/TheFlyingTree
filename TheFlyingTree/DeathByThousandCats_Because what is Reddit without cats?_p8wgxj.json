Oh, you were not one of the founding members? Then how do *you* know this group was created for the purpose you are claiming? Let's look at the subreddit description.\n\n>This is a private community that seeks to emulate a very filtered and curated **microcosm of the Reddit experience**.\n\nCat is one of the topics on Reddit (if not *the* topic) that has the most number of subreddits dedicated to a single idea. What is wrong with including some cats in the mix for the microcosm of the Reddit experience? It was curated through the last culling and I wasn't banned nor was this post deleted.\n\n>People are allowed to post almost anything they want as long as it does not violate the rules and Reddit TOS.\n\nI doubt this post goes against any rules of the subreddit or the Reddit TOS. On the other hand, your unsolicited insults do. No point in oversharing and seeking attention from strangers who couldn't care less if you hate cats or cat-posters. Of course, you are entitled to your own opinions (however self-conflicting and hypocritical they are) and expressions of such.\n\nThis is the internet and people have the freedom to freely express themselves. I won't be gatekeeping the internet from you like you are trying to from me or other random people you have included in your insults. As much as your uncalled hatred is useless and weightless for the rest of us, it doesn't mean that you don't have the right to speak out, since that is what freedom of speech is about. However pointless your points are, I get you don't like cats and that's okay. But you'd do better if you tone down your insults.", "is_submitter": true, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629906483.0, "parent_id": "t1_haav9mr", "replies": []}]}]}]}]}
