Specifically, 65% of women report harassment and statistically receive three times as much derogatory or insulting remarks than men.  \n\n> Insults are frequent in online gaming. According to Stephen Toulouse (moderator of the online gaming service Xbox Live), between 2007 and 2012 women were the most frequent target of harassment.   \n\n\n> A study conducted by Kate O'Halloran in 2017 found that women receive an almost amplified amount of harassment in the setting of online video games than they do in real life, whereas preferential treatment is given to men by other men.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1627772962.0, "parent_id": "t1_h790dwp", "replies": [{"author": "Eyesyt", "id": "h799poz", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "", "submission": "ov7m90", "stickied": false, "body": "That's true to an extent, but studies on this tend to be biased. Men use \"small dick\" and \"no balls\" as an insult online, then women get offended by it. Personally, I tend to avoid throwing dumb insults, but I have observed this thing that happens. Inevitably, there will just be a group of guys throwing insults, then somebody that we all thought was a guy goes \"How dare you! You're only saying that because I'm a woman!\" and throws a tantrum. Then, she blocks everyone and has a crying fit, making the assumption that we were harassing her because she was a woman. Woman are actually more harassed, but they also exaggerate and throw tantrums any time someone says \"no balls.\" The higher harassment may not be right, but it makes sense.
