Where the cells come from at that point is moot, because both the original and the copy would be fundamentally the same entity in the ways that matter to humankind.\n\nSince copying would likely not be an instantaneous process it's likely that the copy would effectively be time shifted after the copying, although if we expand to digital consciousness or cyborg/construct possibilities there is the possibility of near instant copying.  \n\nAll the issues of the [teletransportation paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletransportation_paradox) apply of course but it remains that both the original and the copy are fundamentally starting as the same entity at the moment the copy is made (unless there is a designed or inherent limitation to the copy).
