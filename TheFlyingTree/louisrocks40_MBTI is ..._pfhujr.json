It will give you answers both to your strengths and weaknesses.  \nThe letters are only useful for better identification.\n\nOur nature makes up for about 40% of our decision making. You'd think people are all unique. Well, just like ants or bees have their roles in their society, so do humans.\n\nAfter understanding it, and learning how to type people you will be able to know someone with very few information.  \nYou will know how to improve communication with the person, what are their strengths/weaknesses, insecurities, how to change their minds (including manipulation), make them understand something easier, how to comfort them, make them like or hate you.  \nFor example an INFP insecurity is their reputation (what people think about them). Using this, you can manipulate or pressure one easily.  \n\nAnother important thing that you learn is compatibility between peope. By knowing 2 persons type, I can predict the issues between them. Even their sexual compatibility if they're in a relationship.\n\nAfter learning cognitive functions, I was able to create a better relationship with my family.  \nI'm an INTP. My dad is ISTP. We're both Ti dominant types. This caused lots of arguing.  \nMy mom is an INFJ, her Te is on a very low level, so she never understood my logic and what I have to say. I learned how to word my sentences differently to make her understand me.  \nMy little sister is an ENTP, it is a very (maybe the most) misunderstood type, I'm able to understand her, how she thinks and can help her study the way she learns easier.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630564169.0, "parent_id": "t3_pfhujr", "replies": []}, {"author": "HM_mtl", "id": "hbbf9sg", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #487", "submission": "pfhujr", "stickied": false, "body": "Some of us are/were active on r/mbti (and by extension, r/intp and so on).

Some people I have certain kinds of conversations with and so I think oh they are probably more along the lines of intuitive or sensor. Am I the one reaching out to them all the time? They are probably more of an introvert. Do they like to talk about their relationships and feelings and gossip, or news and theories and things they notice around them? Do they seem more orderly and structured or are they bouncing around to different topics and activities all the time? Basically I use it to navigate social interactions with different kinds of people when their way of being confuses me.\n\nI think most of us lean at least a little this way or the other most of the time, and I just keep these traits in mind when I am getting to know someone so I can set certain expectations for what kinds of interactions and activities will be most effective with which people. I think delving too deep into the theories related to MBTI is mostly a waste of time. So many people see the whole thing as a clear roadmap to understanding themselves and others and will straight up insist that something about themselves or another person can't be true because it doesn't fit their type. \n\nIf I had to be placed into one of the 16 groups based on which describes me best most of the time, it would be ENFP. There are a lot of stereotypical ENFP traits that I do not match and I generally dislike other ENFPs. Some people have insisted that I can't be ENFP because I'm too logical, practical, more selective about who I express certain feelings to or for, etc. \n\nI do like the memes.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630894494.0, "parent_id": "t3_pfhujr", "replies": []}]}
