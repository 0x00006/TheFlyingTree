In  these instances these people (especially one who was a Professor at a Uni teaching Theology), they all claimed to be ex-atheists and in their opinion found their faith to be true.   \n\n\nWhat I surmised from this (and I can't know for sure as I don't live in their head so I don't know how honest they were) was that they never did what I'd call \"the walk\" which is to really think about the existence or non existence of god/gods and what the unobjective proof is. It seemed to me as insincere and like I said, more about doing think god they knew were wrong in the eyes of their faith like a Rumspringa as it were.  \n\n\nThis is not what I am referring to.  \n\n\nYou hear from time to time about ex-pastors who are outspoken atheists- Matt Dillahunty and Dan Barker are two well known examples but for the other way around... there aren't many.   \n\n\nAfter you unpack that morality and religion are not the same thing (I think many religious people conflate the two) and realize that people who are religious can be just as cruel and criminal as atheists (and possible more so due to Moral Liscenceing) you realize that it's not religion that holds you to morals and values but more of a Humanism approach.  \n\n\nDo you think it's possible? After casting a skeptics eye to the idea of God and seeing that there aren't truly evidences do you think you can go back to faith? Doesn't faith sort of require a type of cognitive dissonance that you don't really investigate?  \n\n\nI don't know my thoughts are pretty scattered on this. What do you think?", "score": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/p0dcsv/do_you_think_its_possible_to_go_back_to_faith/", "id": "p0dcsv", "author": "TesseractToo", "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "num_comments": 98, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628423828.0, "comments": [{"author": "Cognizant_Psyche", "id": "h85vyq0", "score": 7, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #151 | Ordo Cognitus", "submission": "p0dcsv", "stickied": false, "body": "For clarification on terms, when I say atheist I mean lack of a belief in a deity, that\u2019s It.  This is also coming from the perspective of someone who left after decades of indoctrination and heavy fanatical beliefs in a radicalized fundamental non denominational sect of Christianity, resulting in landing as an Existential Nihilist after over a decade of self reflection, research, learning, contemplation, and exploring a wide variety of topics such as science, history, philosophy, religions, and psychology.\n\nI find that many atheists who left religion and then returned never really stopped believing in the first place.  They became disenfranchised with the sect, group, traditions, church, peers, or family upbringing they were subjected to, or had a bout of misotheism (what the religious claim us atheists are), but either never understood the core beliefs, read the holy text  (only listened what other people told them it said),and/or still held on to the core tenants of the faith as true but threw the baby out with the bath water.  Then after life happens they fall back into old habits or comforts and become the prodigal son, usually into a different sect or religion that aligns more with how they feel or can accept it as truth.  I hate to say it was just a phase, and there are exceptions I\u2019m sure, but I find it hard for someone who did the due diligence as you said and really took stock of themselves and their beliefs resulting in full abandonment of deistic beliefs to return to what amounts to fantasy ( from the perspective of us heathens when it comes to the existence of a deity).

Or some other event or change that happens in their life.\n\nDue to serious health issues in my family, I've spent a lot of time in hospitals when my grandfather, then my brother and later my father were in hospital for long times. I saw many people who were waiting for donor organs, and just as their time was about to come, they received an organ (most often because of the begin of summer and some motorcycle related accident). Many, after the organ was transplanted, instead of thanking the surgeons who saved their life, or the organ donor (for making the decision to become an organ donor), or the donor's family for not refusing their relative's organs to be donated, thanked god.\n\nThey genuinely believed it must have been god's doing, and one guy who shared a room with my brother for half a year, turned from being completely anti-religious to very religious after his life was saved.\n\nNow I am unsure if this qualifies for the \"the walk\" you mentioned, as these people mostly lost their faith (assuming they were religious before) due to the misfortune cast upon them. \"There can't be a god, because how could he allow this\" (often referring not only to themselves but all the sad fates they learned about while waiting for an organ) quickly turned into \"thank god\".", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628472684.0, "parent_id": "t3_p0dcsv", "replies": []}, {"author": "zephyrsong888", "id": "h88o3bw", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #140", "submission": "p0dcsv", "stickied": false, "body": "Yes.
