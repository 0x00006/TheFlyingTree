The majority of pro-life positions seem to care only that that baby is delivered, and afterword they don't care what happens to it.\n\nSo obviously there's no empathy for the mother coming from a group of people who are trying to governmentally force her to bare her child.  What's worse is the immediate abandonment of any support for the life of the child who they're forcing into existence.\n\nIf a druggy mother accidentally has a child, the pro-life position would be that she should bring that child to term.  But that's where the pro-life position stops thinking about everything and goes on about their day, never concerning themselves with what kind of shitty experience their political preferences just forced onto someone.  Said child will grow up without any support from the people who forced it into existence.  It will grow up with a drug addicted mother.  It will grow up with a higher chance of being addicted to drugs itself.  It will grow up in a crap neighborhood with a crap school and crap parents lowering its potential for escape. It will have a hard life that will be statistically more inclined towards miserable failure.\n\nIf you're pro-life and you're not at all interested in supporting the lives you are forcing into this world then you need to have a long hard think about your positions and whether or not they really adhere to your morality.  How come *every time* I ask a pro-lifer if they're willing to pay an extra tax to support the children who are being born at a disadvantage, or worse born and abandoned, that pro-lifer says 'no, it's not my problem?'  Is it because the pro-life position actually isn't one of empathy but rather one of self serving virtue signaling?", "score": 26, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/p8v9gt/the_prolife_position_almost_always_comes_across/", "id": "p8v9gt", "author": "DDumpTruckK", "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "num_comments": 180, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629565951.0, "comments": [{"author": "stupidmoth_", "id": "h9th9bp", "score": 19, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "", "submission": "p8v9gt", "stickied": false, "body": "as a male outside perspective I think \"pro-life\" is actually just \"anti-rights\" because they always argue how you're killing a baby and such but it's just a cluster of cells with no actual conciousness that's not even alive (in the period abortion is possible) and when faced with arguments and such they often trap themselves in \"I don't care if the mother dies the baby has to live\" so they just want the baby to be born but don't care about them after that and uhhhhh yeah not a fan of that kinda thinking", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629571603.0, "parent_id": "t3_p8v9gt", "replies": [{"author": "TesseractToo", "id": "h9w1vqo", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #96", "submission": "p8v9gt", "stickied": false, "body": "Abortion is possible for the whole term.

Especially since the Holy Texts of the major religions say absolutely *nothing* about abortion, which *absolutely did* happen in time s of antiquity.  I don't know what your religion is, but if it's Christianity then your God is totally ok with abortion.

You're not talking about a system that *legally forces* a woman to birth a child. Are the police going to monitor this mother?  Are they going to escort her to the hospital every month for her check ups?  It's not that what you're suggesting can only exist in a perfect world, it's that even in a perfect world what you're suggesting is stupidly impossible.\n\nAnd worse, you're doing exaclty what I complain about in the post.  You're considering the future of the child *absolutely none*.  You are taking *nothing* about the child's life into consideration and focusing *entirely* on the woman's 'responsibilities'.  You're another person who advocates the forcing of a life into this world, yet refuses to take any responsibility for your own stance.  If you're pro-life you should be paying child support.

But what is a problem for *you* is that self-reporting is all we have, so while we aren't here to claim absolute truth to these statistics, we can reasonably presume the trend is accurate enough to suggest that there is a decent amount of sexual responsibility in the lives of these women.  *Unless you can prove otherwise you have no data to fall back on.*\n\n>So neither of us knows.\n\nAnd none of us knowing for certain doesn't give us a good reason to throw out the statistics, it only means we shouldn't view them as absolute which is fine with me because nothing is absolute in my world view.\n\n> That doesn\u2019t even matter funnily enough because it doesn\u2019t change what I said.\n\nYes and what you said is *three*, count them, *three* different arguments that you keep changing to whenever I point out the flaw in your logic in one of them.\n\n>People should be responsible first.\n\nThe data shows that people are generally reasonably responsible, and that sexually responsible people make up for somewhere near half of abortions.

You wake up on a table, you have tubes stuck in you.  Those tubes connect you to another adult human person.  Doctors say they had to attach him to you in order for him to survive.  They didn't ask you and you have no choice as to whether or not he stays attached to you.  How do you feel about this?

Let's pretend we can see into the future for a child that would be born into a family that isn't ready for it financially or psychologically.  In the future we see drugs, strife, suffering, trauma, depression and eventually suicide.  Is it still bad parenting to abort this child?  Versus, let's say we can see the future for another potential child from the same family, but the only change with this child is it came at a time where the family was ready for it, wanted it, and prepared to face the challenges of responsibly raising a child.  Wouldn't it be better that they abort the child they're not ready for, so they can give the next child that they are ready for a hugely better shot at having a healthy life?\n\nNow obviously the issue is we don't have crystal clear foresight, but to just blanket statement all abortions as bad parenting just doesn't cut it for me.\n\n>What about the other analogy?\n\nThe sports team one?

Calling it pro-life refocuses the argument to the red herring of 'It's a human life' instead of 'I want to remove bodily autonomy from people.'  I just try to approach a position without antagonizing them.  A wolf in sheep's clothing if you will.\n\n> I think there is little point in an emotive argument online.\n\nHere we actually disagree.  I think there's plenty of benefits to having this discussion online.  Firstly and foremost, I'm fucking *sick* of living in a country (the US) where certain topics (a lot actually) are just considered taboo and that everyone is entitled to hold their positions without ever having to justify them, even if only socially.  If you're not willing to have a conversation about a strongly held position then you should not hold that position.  Yet in America almost any political disagreement is considered 'off limits'.  But what that means in reality is people will vote and hold positions that affect other people while never being challenged on it and always feeling uncomfortable to talk about it.  I want people to get the fuck over their stupid fear of having a public disagreement.  I take this culture of 'non-politics' incredibly seriously.\n\nAnother benefit in this abortion context specifically  is it exposes the positions for what they are.  People on the fence or people who are only slightly on my side might come along and see [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/p8v9gt/the_prolife_position_almost_always_comes_across/h9to966?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) comment chain and recognize the position for what it is.\n\nYet another benefit is some of my arguments may be convincing and they may be arguments that others haven't heard before, or heard put that way.  The more people using better arguments the better the word spreads.\n\n>Why use their techniques? I think doing so legitimatises opinions based on emotion.\n\nWell because it's the emotional appeal that worked on them in the first place.  I can't rationalize a person out of a position that they didn't rationalize themselves into.
