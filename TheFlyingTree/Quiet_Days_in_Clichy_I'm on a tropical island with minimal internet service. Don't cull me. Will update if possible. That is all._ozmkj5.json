I'd love to see if you have written anything :D I've gotten around too, I'm in my 4th country\n\nI'm a writer, just not a good one lol. I'm dyslexic and unknowingly my mom told the schools not to help me but I got punished instead for it including being given the strap (which while sexist mostly boys only got the strap, I was the only girl i knew of getting the strap- the logic was that if my hands were red and stinging I'd be more careful about making mistakes). I learned I was dyslexic when a college prof noticed how hard I was studying (he came in the college library and stated seeing me there was 8:30 pm and that my grades were often much lower than the statistical average of someone who had never studied at all) and he got me on the track for a neuropsych evaluation which was interesting, I had a sawtooth pattern on the results that means something but i don't know what (so some results were off the charts high and some were well into the impaired range; so some thing scored the highest tested at that facility but I had greatly impaired other things, for example). Unfortunately since I was over 18 any help was not funded and I couldn't find anyone competent willing to do it privately as I didn't have much of a budget.\n\nI think dyslexia can give you a different perspective/perception though\n\nMostly my writing is me venting about abuse lol :D hmmmm\n\nOh!
