Why do we need to label people based on their skin color or sexual preferences? Well we do not need to do so, but initially people outside of the label say e.g. slave owners felt the need to distinguish themselves from the slaves. Distinguishing feature being skin color they used it as a label to describe the people they owned to justify their actions.\n\nThe word atheist became popularised by the Catholic Church and its Men of God, to shun the non-belivers, distinguish them and brand them as \"different\" from the rest. As is the case often when such things emerge the branded took the label forced upon them, created an identity using the label and used it as a rallying banner for the people who shared their beliefs to join their numbers and normalise the idea of not beliving in God. This process can be more or less traced for any other arbitrary label you might face in life.\n\nAtheists come in many different philosophical and moral flavours. People who some call \"black\" are of many different skin tones. People who some call \"homosexuals\" have a number of other sexual preferences (e.g. being attracted only to people with curly hair). Labels are nothing but arbitrarly placed walls to define some form of \"us\" and \"them\". Any such division is inherently useless, but they can be tools. Tools used by people on either side of the division to accomplish different goals.\n\nPersonally as much as I do not believe in the existance of any god, thus being an atheist by definition I don't partake. Any time anyone asks me about my beliefs they get a full explenation of my philosofical-spirtitual-moral beliefs. Yes I'm a pain in the ass, but I don't want to endorse a mechanism designed for creating divisions between people.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1627904952.0, "parent_id": "t3_ow272i", "replies": []}, {"author": "BuccaneerRex", "id": "h7fdezs", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #96", "submission": "ow272i", "stickied": false, "body": "Why wouldn't I be?\n\nThe problem isn't with me.
