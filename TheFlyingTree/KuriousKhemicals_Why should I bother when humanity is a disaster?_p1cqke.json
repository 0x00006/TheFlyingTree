{"title": "Why should I bother when humanity is a disaster?", "name": "t3_p1cqke", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/p1cqke/why_should_i_bother_when_humanity_is_a_disaster/", "selftext": "The IPCC report came out and while it's zero percent surprising, it's incredibly depressing. And yet the media has the task to act like any of this was unforseen. Guys. For like 30 years *every* prediction about climate change that was put to the test happened ahead of schedule, because there are shitloads of positive feedback loops we didn't know about whereas negative feedback is what maintains equilibrium so we've had centuries to discover those. What the IPCC released today is probably *still* 10-20% on the optimistic side.\n\nI'm 31 years old. I learned about global warming (hadn't been politically renamed at that point) as a kid in school. I was 10 when Al Gore ran against George W. Bush; I favored Gore almost entirely on the basis of his concern for the issue. I've heard since then that his plan to tackle it was flawed and possibly a bit of a corporate handout like what happened with the ACA. Maybe that's so, I wasn't exactly a policy wonk at the age of 10 and at this point it seems pointless to comb through 20 year old policy proposals - but in retrospect, *fucking anything* would have been a worthy start.\n\nBush opposed the Kyoto protocol. US Republicans alternately pushed the line that climate change either wasn't real, wasn't harmful, wasn't caused and couldn't be stopped by humans, or simply refused to consider any policy that might help on free market grounds. Obama prioritized health care instead and then lost Congress and spent the rest of his presidency facing Senate obstructionism and playing whack-a-mole in the Middle East, though at least he did cultivate a position at the Paris accords - from which Trump promptly withdrew. China is building plenty of coal power plants. Bolsonaro is happy to let the Amazon get deforested. I am t i r e d.\n\nThis has been a looming problem since I was a little kid, and I haven't seen a major win my entire lifetime.  What emissions progress has been made, has been made almost exclusively by the natural process of supply and demand, with a small niche of concerned consumers driving more research until new technologies become profitable enough to compete with carbon emitting tech. It's not enough and doesn't come early enough for this kind of problem. We had A LOT of warning and maybe could have limited warming to what we see today, if we had started converting the exponential increase into a level-off and decline 20 years ago. Instead, we'll keep heating up for decades even if emissions hit zero tomorrow. If humanity can't get its shit together and cooperate on this, why should I bother doing anything more aspirational than protecting my own little corner of the world against the flood? Caring doesn't fix anything. Arguing doesn't convince anyone. Politics is a shitshow. If nobody else cares enough about humanity as a whole, why should I put effort into contributing for the good of all?\n\nIt's funny, at the dawn of nuclear technology and for 20-30 years after, there was a sense that we were flirting with danger; much literature explored the possibility of a nuclear holocaust, citizen groups became uneasy and protest grew, and eventually, though we've grudgingly accepted our governments keeping the weapons, nuclear power became unpopular and only a minor component of our energy supply. The supreme irony is that such resistance solidified in the late 1960s, just as the carbon levels were starting to take off, and instead if we bring an environmental holocaust upon ourselves it's likely to be via the fossil fuels that we used at first innocently, then despite knowing their drawbacks, even though nuclear power could have significantly replaced them with little to no carbon load. Then again, maybe that's just what happens when intelligent beings handle such large amounts of energy, and it would have led to disaster either way. Or maybe humans are uniquely Icarian, and there are plenty of alien races who handled the energy needs of their civilization growth just fine, and have kept themselves hidden specifically because we always overreach and destroy everything we touch. \n\nSo yeah, I'm a bit down on humanity and disappointed that Star Trek Earth is largely not a possibility anymore. Nevermind warp travel and all, but utopian coexistence on Earth? That seemed like a possibility so long as it was only our own bickering over differences that limited us, and the climate clock still had time on it. I kind of want to go to Mars a la \"The Dispossessed\" and start over with people who get it and give a shit, or at least the Mars trilogy where it's being made suitable for life for the first time, a fresh start. We're going to need carbon capture at a minimum and probably geoengineering to save this place, and it still won't be the same, and frankly I don't know if we're gonna do it. Maybe we just have a population collapse from mass famine and hopefully I've moved to a defensible subsistence commune in Alaska by then.", "score": 40, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/p1cqke/why_should_i_bother_when_humanity_is_a_disaster/", "id": "p1cqke", "author": "KuriousKhemicals", "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "num_comments": 88, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628550201.0, "comments": [{"author": "calmlikeasexbobomb", "id": "h8d0tet", "score": 14, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #262", "submission": "p1cqke", "stickied": false, "body": "Wait until you find out just how much of this was put in motion by the oil companies.

Demand that governments pass a law, that will set up a randomly selected group of citizens like a jury to look at expert opinions on climate change, how fast it needs to be dealt with, and what options are available, and then automatically pass whatever they decide as law.\n\nThat's it. No solution you're selling to people, just a commitment to get random ordinary citizens to grapple with the scale of the problem and decide what needs to be done.\n\nBecause the evidence of [past](https://www.climatechangenews.com/2019/06/27/irelands-world-leading-citizens-climate-assembly-worked-didnt/) \"citizens' assemblies\" shows, if you ask people to take some time off and actually look through it, people of every political persuasion come up with and agree concrete solutions, and so the demand that people just recognise the problem and sit down and deal with it is not just a glib emotional phrase, it's something specific you can actually demand.\n\nAll they need is volume, enough people pissed off enough to say\n\n\"\nDon't listen to us, don't do what *we* want, just because we're causing a fuss, recognise the problem and get other people to decide what to do, random people, we trust that they'll come to the right conclusion.\n\nAnd if you don't, we'll keep causing disruption, and intentionally getting arrested for it, until you take this seriously.\n\"\n\nIt's easy to participate in, you don't need to have everything figured out, you just need to be willing to put your feelings into action.\n\nAnd if enough people do this, their impact is far higher than any other kind of protest, even greater in impact than people violently attacking the government.

I'll just add on that all hope isn't lost but a lot of the things you think won't happen any more weren't gonna happen in our life times anyways (I'm 31 too).  I do wish we weren't so afraid of nuclear though.  Its been shown that if you run it properly you don't have much to worry about it.  And in comparison to \"green energy\" you can make a strong argument that its more green then they are (at least with current technologies).    \n\n\nBut yes the climate isn't great and is still getting worse.
