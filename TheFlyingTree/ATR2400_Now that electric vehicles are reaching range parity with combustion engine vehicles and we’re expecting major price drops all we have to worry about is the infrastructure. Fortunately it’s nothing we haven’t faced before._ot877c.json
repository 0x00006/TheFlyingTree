Where are you going to charge your vehicle?\u201d\n\nThe infrastructure for combustion engine vehicles didn\u2019t appear out of nowhere. Just like we\u2019re trying to do with charging now, all these gas stations and the complex fuel supply routes had to be built up over a long period of time. I\u2019m sure the original cars faced this same argument. \u201cWhere are you going to fuel up your car when it runs out of gas in the middle of a trip? With a horse all you have to do is feed it anywhere and you\u2019re good to go!\u201d \n\nSure we\u2019re going to have to build the infrastructure but so did our ancestors for the combustion engine. This challenge is hardly anything new. In fact it might even be easier. For combustion engines you have to have trucks ship gasoline from halfway across the country 24/7. For electricity you can just plug into the grid. No tankers required. As long as the power plant keeps running you can provide power to as many people as you want without needing to have fuel shipped in.", "score": 15, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/ot877c/now_that_electric_vehicles_are_reaching_range/", "id": "ot877c", "author": "ATR2400", "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "num_comments": 63, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1627472525.0, "comments": [{"author": "DELETED", "id": "h6tjuzm", "score": 8, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": null, "submission": "ot877c", "stickied": false, "body": "[deleted]", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1627473576.0, "parent_id": "t3_ot877c", "replies": [{"author": "Zealousideal_Mix_629", "id": "h6to7ls", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #13 | Legio Virtus", "submission": "ot877c", "stickied": false, "body": "They use kinetic storage now, it's called a lake.
