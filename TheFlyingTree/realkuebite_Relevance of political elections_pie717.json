They don't really look for information or so, maybe they will just vote based on what they already picked up or do not vote at all.\n\nSo as I think elections are important because of many reasons, I am looking for various other opinions on that topic, maybe trying to start a small discussion about politics.", "score": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/pie717/relevance_of_political_elections/", "id": "pie717", "author": "realkuebite", "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "num_comments": 5, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630852547.0, "comments": [{"author": "CreativityTheEmotion", "id": "hbp73wp", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #646", "submission": "pie717", "stickied": false, "body": "I've gotten involved in a political party, and subsequently all elections it participates in, because a political party struck my fancy.\n\nI'm afraid I don't have a very good idea on what people outside parties think, especially since a party is about *promoting* a way of thinking, not *understanding* one.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630857616.0, "parent_id": "t3_pie717", "replies": [{"author": "realkuebite", "id": "hbp9xq0", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #648", "submission": "pie717", "stickied": false, "body": "I am also a member of a party, that's why I busy myself with politics more than others tend to do.
