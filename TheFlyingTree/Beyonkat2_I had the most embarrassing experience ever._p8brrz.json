And no offense to her, I wasnt really surprised (I know that's not a nice thing to say but it's the truth), so I replied \"Oh my gosh! Congrats!\" And she said \"Thanks lmao, but I was just taking senior pictures and wanted to do something fun at the end.\" And now I want to die from embarassment because I feel like the densest idiot to exist in the world.", "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/p8brrz/i_had_the_most_embarrassing_experience_ever/", "id": "p8brrz", "author": "Beyonkat2", "link_flair_text": "Event", "num_comments": 15, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629486514.0, "comments": [{"author": "TSM-", "id": "h9p7hy1", "score": 28, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #39", "submission": "p8brrz", "stickied": false, "body": "The answer is always to double down.
