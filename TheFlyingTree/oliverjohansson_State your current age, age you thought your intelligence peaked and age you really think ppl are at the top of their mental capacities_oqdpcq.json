I don't recall the study, but a few years ago some results came out that said that absent an abnormal cause, cognitive speed reduction comes because they're sorting through a lot more information rather than because they are slower. \n\nAs brains grow and change, you add and lose neural connections. The more any given connection is used, e.g. in a memory or thought process, the more that connection is strengthened. The upshot of this is that over time the more useful pathways become ingrained and the less useful ones fade out. \n\nI'm smarter now than I have ever been, because I have a much bigger database to use as inputs to my mental models of reality. I was a freaking genius as a kid, but I was the really, really stupid kind of genius. I'd say idiot savant except I was never really that good at any one thing.
