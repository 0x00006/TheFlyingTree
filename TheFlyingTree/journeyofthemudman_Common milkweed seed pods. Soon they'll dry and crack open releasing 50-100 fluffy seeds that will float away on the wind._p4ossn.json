In a small field at a fork in the road, where it went to either side of the lake we were on, there was a huge milkweed patch. Like, not quite you can't see the other side, because you could, but more like you could fit a small big rig parking lot in it.\n\nWhen I was young, up until I was 12 or so, my mom my brother and I would walk out there in October or sometime around then in the Autumn, and we'd just fluff the milkweed.\n\nAs you probably know, milkweed seeds have like this amazing white fluff that could probably be pillow stuffing, and the pods just open right up through the middle, crack that goes all the way from top to bottom.\n\nSo when they've opened up and the seeds are blowing away, we just take our hands and fingers and throw it all around, getting most, if not all of the seeds out.\n\nSo my lesson to you all is: Fluff the milkweed seeds when they come out, it's very fun.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629116517.0, "parent_id": "t3_p4ossn", "replies": []}]}
