I'm excited to get going but also....a little scared.  WHy is that?  I've done a few backpacking trips before, but this one has got me a little shook up.\n\nThere are 3 of us, but I only invited 1 and the second person essentially invited herself.  I'm old and this is my trip to take and manage before I'm too old to do it, so an extra person adds complexity that could torpedo the trip.\n\nThe drive will be almost an entire day....will we be able to efficiently get this part done?  Will we be able to drive through or do we have to stop? or will the driver get sleepy and crash?\n\nWill we have water?  \n\nI move and get started faster, while the other two like to dawdle.  Remember, this is my trip....will I get pissed that they are not considering this?  They are a couple, so while the trip was intended to be just me and the other....its now going to be 'them as a couple' and me as a third person.\n\nWill my body hold up for the long trek?  Will I really enjoy it?  \n\nSo many emotions.", "score": 26, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/p1pnny/major_backpacking_trip_tomorrow_and_many_emotions/", "id": "p1pnny", "author": "04221970", "link_flair_text": "META", "num_comments": 35, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628603712.0, "comments": [{"author": "caparisme", "id": "h8evo13", "score": 10, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "", "submission": "p1pnny", "stickied": false, "body": "And you didn't consider to discuss with them about this?", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628605294.0, "parent_id": "t3_p1pnny", "replies": [{"author": "04221970", "id": "h8exphv", "score": 5, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #110", "submission": "p1pnny", "stickied": false, "body": "off topic....can you tell me why you don't have a flair like the rest of us?
