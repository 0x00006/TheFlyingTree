Red, Andy's main inmate friend, isn't comfortable with Andy's involvement. Andy explains the practice would be happening whether he was laundering the money or not and explains\n\n> Yeah, I know. There's a fine line there. What it comes down to, Red, is some people refuse to get their hands dirty at all. That's called sainthood, and the pigeons land on your shoulders and crap all over your shirt. The other extreme is to take a bath in the dirt and deal any goddamned thing that will turn a dollar-guns, switchblades big H....\n\nAdding\n\n> This is hell right here. Right here in The Shank. They sell pills and I tell them what to do with the money. But I've also got the library, and I know of over two dozen guys who have used the books in there to help them pass their high school equivalency tests. Maybe when they get out of here they'll be able to crawl off the shit heap. When we needed that second room back in 1957, I got it. Because they want to keep me happy. I work cheap. That's the trade-off.\n\nLater in the book, Andy explains how he was hoping he'd not have been convicted but took precautions nonetheless incase he was,\n\n> Suppose there was a house full of rare paintings and sculptures and fine old antiques, Red? And suppose the guy who owned the house heard that there was a monster of a hurricane headed right at it? One of those two kinds of men just hopes for the best. The hurricane will change course, he says to himself. No right-thinking hurricane would ever dare wipe out all these Rembrandts, my two Degas horses, my Grant Woods, and my Bentons. Furthermore, God wouldn't allow it. And if worse comes to worst, they're insured. That's one sort of man. The other sort just assumes that hurricane is going to tear right through the middle of his house. If the weather bureau says the hurricane just changed course, this guy assumes it'll change back in order to put his house on ground-zero again. **This second type of guy knows there's no harm in hoping for the best as long as you're prepared for the worst.**", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629940215.0, "parent_id": "t3_pbm32a", "replies": []}, {"author": "RoyalEagle0408", "id": "hadgbml", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #173", "submission": "pbm32a", "stickied": false, "body": "\"Your now is not your forever\".- John Green, Turtles All the Way Down  \n\n\nCliche, I know, but I was about 9 months from finishing grad school and it just...hit me in a deep way.
