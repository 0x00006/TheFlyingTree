Me and sister at first tried to wash her with a shower in our upstairs bathroom (we were dumb, stressed and didn't know what to do)but let's just say she hated it. So her friend suggested we washed her with non-perfumed soap, it worked, we used the soap and poured the water through a bowl and scrubbed her fur to wash the soap. \n\nOnce done, we cleaned our upstairs bathroom,I dried her and put both our cats in our much larger  bathroom that is downstairs, to isolate her since there was still a stench, it's late, my sister is tired so we'll do it tomorrow.\n\nUpdate: We received a text from our mum (She is on vacation) and she recommended to us that if after the second wash she still stink, we must shave her.

Poor cat. Smell is a very important part of their lives.\n\nI hope the suggestions here work to get her back to smelling like herself.\n\nIf I may cautiously and gently make a suggestion going forward, perhaps it's better to keep your cats inside. I'm not sure where you live.\n\nIn the U.S. about 3 billion birds a year, that's billion with a B, are killed by house cats every year. \n\nI don't know the statistics on mammals and other wildlife killed by house cats.\n\nThere is also always a risk with an outdoor cat that something will happen to them outside, such as getting hit by a car.\n\nGenerally, it's safer for everyone to keep your cats indoors.\n\nI hope I haven't offended you with the suggestion. But, as a wildlife enthusiast and a cat lover and cat ~~owner~~ slave myself, I can't help but point out the dangers to both the cats and the wildlife for letting cats go outside.\n\nAll the best in getting rid of the smell. I hope it wasn't too traumatic for your cat.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629009488.0, "parent_id": "t3_p4lqq1", "replies": [{"author": "Fri3dNstuff", "id": "h9194jp", "score": 3, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #49 | Consortii Concordus", "submission": "p4lqq1", "stickied": false, "body": "I heard two opposing sides of this argument, one which says it's dangerous to let the cats outside and the other saying that it's cruel to keep them in...

And also because of the probably roughly equal harm they do to the population of small native mammals and other creatures. Cats of any size are quite seriously excellent predators. Since most of the house cat's range is where they are introduced, invasive, exotics, this is quite damaging.\n\nThe two cats my wife and I recently re-rescued are a mother and daughter. The mother grew up in the burbs as a feral cat. She was rescued with a litter of 3 kittens and taken in. The other two kittens were separated. Mom ended up back with one of the kittens. We have mom and that kitten (~4 and 2 years old when we got them).\n\nSo, the mom clearly knows what it's like to live outside. But, now she lives in an apartment. She not only does not seem at all unhappy about not wondering where her next meal is coming from, she doesn't even try to come out on the balcony with us.\n\nThey will stalk and try to hunt by instinct. They learn to kill as a learned skill. But, their hunger and hunting are completely separate in their minds. A well-fed house cat will actually kill *more* than a feral cat because s/he is healthier and better fed so is better able to kill, even though they may or may not even bother to eat the kill.\n\nCats can be perfectly happy inside. Most species of cats sleep 20 hours a day anyway. I'm not sure of the exact number for house cats.\n\nP.S. We know more about the effects of cats on birds than on other wildlife just because birders are a pretty obsessive bunch and are always out there watching birds.\n\n[edited again for minor corrections]", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629040539.0, "parent_id": "t1_h9194jp", "replies": []}]}]}, {"author": "logoyahoo", "id": "h91vyrh", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #80", "submission": "p4lqq1", "stickied": false, "body": "If she has black fur I\u2019d lean into it.
