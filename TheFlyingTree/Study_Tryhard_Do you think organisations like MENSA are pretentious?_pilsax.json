Another thing, IQ does not define intelligence, so I dont see how these people can think of themselves as smart, they simply scored higher than 132 on a standard IQ test that they could have practiced for, who knows? Some people really are that insecure about their intelligence they feel validation from a simple 3 digit number that doesnt tell the whole story.\n\nAnyway feel free to humour me with your thoughts,\n\nps: This sub kinda does have a mensa feel so this post is kind of ironic: *No idiocy, filtered and curated, likeminded*", "score": 11, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/pilsax/do_you_think_organisations_like_mensa_are/", "id": "pilsax", "author": "Study_Tryhard", "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "num_comments": 43, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630877334.0, "comments": [{"author": "BuccaneerRex", "id": "hbqld1x", "score": 16, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #96", "submission": "pilsax", "stickied": false, "body": "Everyone wants to be special.

(It's not an acronym.  \"Mensa\" is just Latin for \"table\".). I was invited to speak at it.  My local Mensa branch had a subgroup that got together for food once a month, and invited in someone from another organization that Mensa members might find fun, to talk about that other organization and answer questions.  So they fed me dinner to come chat to them about the SCA.  It was totally pleasant.\n\nI do not think organizations like Mensa are pretentious.  I think our society is wildly prejudiced against smart people, and one expression of that is whenever smart people might want to hang out with one another for any reason whatsoever, it gets attacked as somehow unsavory or them getting up to no good.  But if people who are good at sports \u2013 who are athletically gifted \u2013 can get together with one another in elite athletic leagues or athletic clubs, and nobody thinks anything is wrong with that, and\u00a0people who excel at the arts \u2013 who are artistically gifted \u2013 can have residencies at artists colonies and have auditioned ensembles, and nobody thinks anything is wrong with that, then why can't intellectually gifted people get together for the hell of it without other people being all weird about it?\n\nAnd to be blunt, one of the things being smart affects is one's conversations.  While it's totally possible for people of two different intelligence levels to have a lovely and meaningful and even mutually educational conversation, it's not wrong for smart people to want to have other smart people to have the kinds of conversations with that only smart people can have with one another.  Those are also valuable and even emotionally important conversations to have, in that they reduce loneliness and help one feel appreciated and challenged and invigorated.\n\nAbraham Maslow once said that every capacity is also a need.  Smart people need to exercise their smarts; it's bad for their mental health if they don't.  Animals kept in too small cages start pulling out their own fur.
