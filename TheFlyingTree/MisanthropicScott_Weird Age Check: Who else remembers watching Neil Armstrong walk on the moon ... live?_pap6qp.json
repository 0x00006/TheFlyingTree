I asked my parents about it.\n\nWhat he said (from memory, feel free to correct me): \"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.\"\n\nI asked my parents don't man and mankind mean the same thing in that?\n\nMy mother explained that he meant to say \"one small step for ***a*** man\".\n\nI think there was a later astronaut who, on stepping on the moon said something like, \"whooieee! That may be a small step for Neil but it's a big one for me!\"\n\nAnyway, just curious how many others we have here in my age group or older.\n\n**P.S.
