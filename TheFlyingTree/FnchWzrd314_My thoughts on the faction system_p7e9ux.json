Just saying.\n\nMy actual thoughts on the subject go thusly, tribalism is really really good, and really really bad. Bad because it creates an us-them situation, which is infamously bad for cooperation between groups, here in Australia, people have died because the supported the wrong football team, I'm not sure who this reflects more badly on, but it's gotten to the point where Blues can't enter Maroon bars for a couple months of the year.\n\nGood because it encourages teamwork, in an us-them situation, you have to rely on each-other, and that is great, it encourages really good teamwork and cooperation between smaller groups in exchange for wide scale, less tight teamwork, up to you which is better\n\nAnd now for this week's Tidbit:\n\nThe IPA is a system if notation that transcribes every sound in every known language, as a conlanger, this is incredibly useful, because it allows you to know what has precedent in the real world and to concisely show what sound you mean\n\nPersonally, the hardest sound I've ever used in anything is probably the voiced uvular fricative, And I will link to some stuff with more details later, when it isn't midnight.\n\nEdit: misnamed the faction, really demonstrating my inability to Latin there.", "score": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/p7e9ux/my_thoughts_on_the_faction_system/", "id": "p7e9ux", "author": "FnchWzrd314", "link_flair_text": "META", "num_comments": 19, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629377701.0, "comments": [{"author": "04221970", "id": "h9j5nim", "score": 17, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #110", "submission": "p7e9ux", "stickied": false, "body": "I'm not really on board.
