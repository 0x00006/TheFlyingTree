It seems like you're complaining about really specific instances, but I can't respond to them just based on your summary of what happened.  I don't know what tweet from Dave Rubin you're talking about, but I've heard the things that come out of Dave's mouth and it would probably be fair to say he's destroyed any and all benefit of the doubt that Twitter might have tried to give someone for posting a bad COVID take.

Private companies have financial and other interests which bias them to discriminate between individuals and groups. Government regulation to prevent said discrimination by ISPs is ideal. If another business is offering a similar product/service, just layered on top of the internet access provided by your ISP, I think the same principal should apply, legally speaking.\n\nAWS, GCP, Azure, etc all offer hosting services that are becoming more and more the way most everyone hosts content/platforms on the web.  These services offer access to anyone who is willing to pay for them, and the content created by customers is accessible by anyone who can reach their servers via an ISP.  Consequently, I believe they should be held to the same standard as ISPs as far as discrimination. If you are going to offer a public product, especially of that size and nature, that is meant for allowing others to build upon, you shouldn\u2019t get to dictate what they can or can\u2019t say (Assuming it is legal) by denying them access to your services.  This is what happened with AWS, GCP, and Apple in regard to Parler, a conservative alternative social platform ([NYTimes Article](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2021/01/09/technology/apple-google-parler.amp.html)).  Amazon, Google, and Apple aren\u2019t lawmakers, nor agencies of law enforcement, and really have no business trying to go beyond what the law already states regarding what is allowed or not allowed to be hosted on the internet. If a judge has ordered something to be removed, or if something is illegal in its entirety, then by all means it shouldn\u2019t be allowed to be hosted. Ultimately that is up to a judge to decide though. But, removing Parler was definitely discrimination, no matter how fancily the justification was dressed up by AWS and others.\n\nSocial media platforms, which I see as the next layer in this, also offer a product which is public in nature (Anyone, relatively speaking, is allowed to join).  Consequently, if they choose to start discriminating against who can or cannot use their platform, based on what those individuals believe (and then say), we run into the same problem, namely that this is discrimination. The issue as it pertains to social media platforms may be a bit more nuanced, but I think the general principle applies.  If you offer a public platform which anyone can access, you should not be able to discriminate against beliefs people hold to, which are protected under the 1st Amendment.\n\nAt the end of the day, this is really simple: We shouldn\u2019t discriminating against people for lawful speech, regardless of how appalling or outrageous we perceive it to be.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630334715.0, "parent_id": "t3_pecx6z", "replies": []}, {"author": "kindasortasalty", "id": "haxod29", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #33", "submission": "pecx6z", "stickied": false, "body": "It\u2019s needed in some places but can become pervasive and overreaching when unchecked", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630335185.0, "parent_id": "t3_pecx6z", "replies": []}, {"author": "logoyahoo", "id": "hay84bl", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #80", "submission": "pecx6z", "stickied": false, "body": "I agree with you.

The business is registered in the Cayman Islands, and leases servers from a company in Egypt, while the ads are displayed on japanese websites, through google ad sense. According to your logic they should be persecuted under US law, however US has no jurisdiction (i.e. cannot legally gather evidence either), over any of these places. However if we agree that the home state of the internet user has exclusive jurisdiction, then it is illegal for all the other states mentioned (Egypt, Japan, Cayman Islands) to take legal action, as they do not have jurisdiction over the user.   \n\n\nOr suppose a russian contractor hacker is tasked with extracting data from a US company.

The rules for federal proceedings are clearly outlined, even you mention it when can one be charged with sex trafficing. The rules for prosecution over internet action are not defined.

The current free for all is highly detrimental for all internet users, it benefits only the states and state backed companies.
