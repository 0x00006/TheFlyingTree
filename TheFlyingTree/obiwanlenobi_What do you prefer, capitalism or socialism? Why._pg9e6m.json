The exact name, i dont know. Imagine you cross a socialist, a libertarian, and a communist.   \n\n\nLike, capitalism is pretty much--if you dont make a profit, you can just fuck off and die. The sooner you do either one, the better. If you can turn a profit AND die, whoa boy, REALLY do that, it'll make room for the next customer. Just die before you can let them know we killed ya.  It's brutal.   \n\n\nSo, when a capitalist or righty hears 'free college' they're all shitting bricks about their whole 60 cents in taxes they may have to pay for that, thinking we'll just give money to people who go. No, what it means is that--in order to create a better, higher educated, licensed, trade-certified and apprenticed workforce, NO ONE should be paying for secondary education/trades/apprenticeships. We're not giving you money, but there's no fucking reason to pay tuition in this country. I suppose THAT.   \n\n\nHigh speed transit--not a hard concept, if we can get it going the pressure we take off of roads, and the ease with which people in rural communities can get to education and higher paying jobs becomes extraordinary. Due to high speed rail, people in Japan can live HUNDREDS of miles from where they work. When people bitch about 'down town' traffic, or hate how the city's always a clusterfuck, mass and high speed transit is the solution to this. I suppose that. Yes it costs money.   \n\n\nI also support investing in systems and businesses that are for public benefit. Some of these are a no brainer--fire, police, roads, DOT, food safety, BUT--health insurance, prisons, and education, those things should not be FOR PROFIT driven. When you let profits make the choices in those environments, you end up with the fucked up shit we have now.   \n\n\nI'm for workers having a greater say in the operation of businesses. Frankly, Unions. We need more, they need to be stronger. Oddly, this is something many in the right CAN support, but they keep voting for rich business oligarchs that strip away union rights ...   \n\n\nI'm for as little government mandate, and tinkering as possible, but where it IS--should stand as an open door to make it possible for everyone to do better. That doesnt mean i expect everyone to do that, some people are just lazy pricks--what ever, we need those too. It's just that--no one should ever NOT get a secondary education because money was a factor. No one should skip going to a DR because they cant pay. No one should ever feel like living 35 miles out of a city is a death sentence for their careers due to commute times.   \n\n\nTHAT's the 'socialism' i support.   \n\n\nThere's more, but it's already too wordy", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630554219.0, "parent_id": "t3_pg9e6m", "replies": [{"author": "El_Duque_Caradura", "id": "hbc4gy2", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #296", "submission": "pg9e6m", "stickied": false, "body": "Very well, come to Argentina, we do as you ask and more...
