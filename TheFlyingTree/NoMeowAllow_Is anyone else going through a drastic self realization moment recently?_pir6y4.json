When I watched myself, it was like watching a stranger. The way my mind works and what I look like are two separate entities. I have never tried to actually look at myself because I\u2019ve been scared of being a narcissist. \n\nI can also relate to not recognizing your own voice. I sound so weird bro. Like it\u2019s scary. I\u2019ve never actually listened to myself so in my second video I simply talked about what came to mind without caring I was filming, because no one will ever see it besides me. I literally view it as a case study or whatever on myself. This was a ramble but hopefully you\u2019ll be able to make some sense out of it if you actually care.

I\u2019ve struggled a long time with the feeling of being \u201cfake\u201d when being happy because I don\u2019t truly feel it. So put on a mask and pretend and before too long you actually become happy. You are what you eat right? If you feel like you\u2019re coming across as happy then you are and screw everyone else judging you. It doesn\u2019t matter. Like unless there going to physically assault you I don\u2019t think there needs to be a second thought. You can judge real quick if someone is really going to fuck with you or if they just peacocking. Most the time it\u2019s peacocking and I\u2019ll just let them take the win and I\u2019ll back off. It\u2019s not cowardice, it\u2019s simply realizing it doesn\u2019t fucking matter and it\u2019s a waste of your time to even deal with. You got better stuff to do and you\u2019re probably more successful at life than this peacocker. All bark no bite. First step Is of course just follow basic courtesy and respect social norms. But sometimes shit happens. I drunkenly stumbled back onto a guy once (kinda sketchy dude) and he said \u201cI\u2019m not playin.\u201d When I laughed and apologized for falling into him. I just nodded seriously at him and walked away. What the point. Got nothing to prove to him or anyone else there. For you though, with the schizoid, I literally cannot imagine what that\u2019s like. I express stuff on my face and I have a hard time. I guess the whole point of this was to say don\u2019t worry if you\u2019re making a \u201cmask\u201d or not.
