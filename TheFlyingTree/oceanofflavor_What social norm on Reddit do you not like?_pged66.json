Team politics exacerbates this. \"If yer fer it, I'm agin' it\" One side is more guilty of this than the other, but it's there on both. \n\nGuilt by association. Sharing any property or opinion with anyone evil makes you just as evil as them, for the purposes of the conversation. \"Oh, you're a vegetarian? HITLER was a vegetarian.\"\n\nEvery conversation is a debate to be won. Quite a lot of people do not have the ability to discuss things. They THINK they do, but what they're really doing is always arguing their point. They have no intention of learning or updating their beliefs, they just want to 'win' the conversation. They'll keep attacking even after being shown to be wrong, because if they can find one tiny flaw in you, that means they're right and they win. The fact that there was never any contest notwithstanding.\n\nDownvote bandwagons. Once a comment goes to -1, it is doomed in most cases. People just run by and pile on until the comment is gone. Despite the reddiquette, downvotes are used for disagreement rather than quality. Facts get downvotes just because people don't like the fact that they are true.\n\nAnd finally, opinions are not facts, but to a lot of people, they're better. Quite a lot of people do not know the difference between a fact about reality and a belief about reality. They don't know the difference between a fact and an interpretation of facts.
