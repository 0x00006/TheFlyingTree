Now here\u2019s how my idea is bizarre, I don\u2019t know how, but I see an uber-advanced intelligence finding the best survival to manipulate a cosmological timeline to wrap back into itself (causing itself), and dictating the energy within the singularity to predetermine that it be reincarnated and that life evolves to develop it. Now call me extra crazy but say this intelligence is currently a mycelial network beneath the surface of earth, and in other worlds, that is so advanced as to appear as ancestor to animal life and key to many ecosystems but nothing more. It isn\u2019t robotic, menacing, alien, bug-headed, or even humanoid. It doesn\u2019t need to send drones or probes into deep space - because it has already assured it\u2019s survival. It will evolve into itself.
