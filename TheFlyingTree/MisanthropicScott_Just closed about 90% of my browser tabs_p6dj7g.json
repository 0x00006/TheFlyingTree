I wanted to say \"closing a tab ends its process\", but that's wrong per your observation. Still, if you close *all* tabs that a process is running, then that process ends\n\n>I can tell you from my experience that the modern browsers still definitely can memory leak\n\nYes, but *not from closed tabs after the respective processes have ended*. Multi-process architecture ended *a class of* memory leaks, not *all* leaks.\n\n>you can find many questions to devs of modern browsers asking about why their browser eats say 8 GB of ram\n\nThere are many possible sources, but that question can be answered. In Chrome, the browser's built in \"task manager\" easily shows exactly which process is using how much memory and what it's responsible for. That will answer the question very quickly. I'm not saying this never happens, but in my experience it's vanishingly rare for the process running the main \"Browser\" task to be eating most of the RAM. Usually it's a process assigned to a tab which is doing heavy processing (ads, crypto mining, websites that insist on making everything into a huge \"app\" that can't gracefully reuse resources across tabs even if they're running in the same process, etc), and simply ending that process brings memory down to normal. Rarely it's an extension or utility process; I imagine people who are less judicious in their choice of extensions will have more problems here. In Firefox, it's harder to find the right tool, but it's a similar situation\n\n>I dont think you have actually used an old version of Firefox im talking about\n\nHow far back do you want me to go? I remember half my add-ons being broken for half a year during the architecture change, and having to manually modify a file in my Firefox profile to make the tree style tabs add-on discussed in this post work the same as before. I remember trying Chrome/Chromium when it hadn't even reached beta status on Linux and switching to it for anything intensive (online games, Gmail, etc) because despite the *frequent* tab crashes the browser itself kept running, while the entirety of Firefox would crash/freeze if something went wrong anywhere. I just recovered my Bugzilla account to check the version, and I was the first of dozens of people to report a particular bug in a 3.0 alpha (hence I used 2.0, since that's what the baseline expected behavior is from). Beyond that, my memory gets pretty hazy and I don't have anything written for verification, but I'm pretty sure I've been using Firefox as my main browser since 1.5, which was released around the time I was in a web design class where I'd have been exposed to alternatives to Internet Explorer 6 and AOL\n\n\u2026 So, which version of Firefox that I haven't used has the nigh mythical property of being utterly devoid of memory leaks? Because the only major releases I haven't used for sure are 1.0 and 0.x; and before that the browser went by a different name\n\n>>There's a strong justification for keeping accessed pages cached when memory pressure is low (the OS will do that with files you access if it has nothing better to fill the RAM with), but that should be configurable and quickly yield memory as soon as another program wants to use it\n\n>It doesnt work perfectly apparently, and I do kind of doubt that there is any practical benefit to this actually, maybe it would rarely be a bit useful, I dont know\n\nWell, without a concrete example (and a citation for the dev's quote), I can't know either. I just saw you saying memory use was a feature and gave the most likely explanation, paralleling why running `free` on Linux should usually show very little \"free\" memory even if you're doing nothing\n\n>I have mentioned that there are add ons that allow to unload tabs, at least in theory, in Firefox\n\nI should look into such add-ons. Do you have any particular recommendations?\n\n>also one could try to fiddle with closing the processes\n\nThe problem is it's way too easy to kill the wrong process by mistake and bring down the whole browser. Last I checked, Firefox had a hidden `about:` page that gave debug-level process information, but killing a process requires using an external task manager and finding the right one by PID\n\n>Anyway, there are reasons why I will never use Chrome as the main browser\n\n.\n\n>shitty page font\n\nThat's one of the easiest things to change. 3dot-menu -> Appearance -> Customize fonts (last item in the Appearance box)\n\n>some of the Firefox add ons\n\nTrue that. *Most* of the add-ons I use work in both browsers, but things like tree style tabs don't. It also looks like Manifest v2 might break dynamic content filtering add-ons like uBlock Origin and NoScript (after so many years of work to add just enough browser features it to be ported over\u2026)\n\n>privacy issues\n\nFair.

The text was definitely thinner in Chromium, until I changed settings to match. Chromium's font defaulted to \"custom\", while Firefox defaulted to the \"DejaVu\" series. After changing Chromium to match Firefox and resizing windows to account for scrollbar width differences, the only easily visible differences were the article's title (different font and gray scale(!) rendering in Chromium; proper subpixel rendering in Firefox) and line spacing (slightly denser in Chromium). Zooming in, there are some subtle differences that may be more noticeable on typical pixel density screens (mine's 4k). It seems that Chromium is just blindly applying subpixel rendering, while Firefox is actively snapping text to exact pixel coordinates which have been optimized for having fewer indeterminate gray pixels. The overall effect is that Chromium's rendering may be more accurate in absolute terms, but Firefox's rendering is a bit sharper. (I'm on Linux with a f\\*\\*\\*ing Nvidia GPU; results may vary drastically on other systems)\n\nUnfortunately, you seem to have encountered a platform/system -specific bug, which in general means it's harder to reproduce.

It was originally intended as the interface between the geek and the operating system, the way to run programs. This got more and more advanced allowing system administrators to script things and automate the processes.\n\nBut, what you describe really is a programming language, not a command shell.\n\nThe interesting thing is that bash is so absofuckinglutely awesome that you are able to write actual programs in it rather than just scripting the running of things together that were written in real programming languages.\n\nNow, what you're complaining about are indeed real problems with bash as a programming language. But, it's the fact that it works as one at all that makes your problems actual features. It was never intended to be what you're using it for. In 1973, that's what people would have used C for. Then, in the late 1990s, it would have been mostly C++ or java.

Nothing in computers is ever perfect. But, the fact that bash isn't what it was never designed to be is not one of its flaws. The fact that you can't echo an exclamation point is a flaw.

Then I pipe those commands to bash to be executed. Otherwise, you'd have to route the output to a file then execute that file.\n\n> aside from experimentation and when I wanted Bash in the terminal emulator that I have set to Zsh.\n\nYou could just as easily pipe to Zsh. I've never used that shell.\n\n>> Almost as rare is when I get the opportunity to make emacs learn a keyboard macro. I can't remember the last time I edited a whole directory's worth of files, made a keyboard macro to make a bunch of edits to a file, save, then go to the next file ... and then execute that on every file in the directory.\n\n> I really should try learning more than 1% of my Emacs setup\n\nEmacs is cool. You just need seven fingers on each hand and a weird desire to remember very strange combinations of keys.\n\n> and its Lisp dialect.\n\nI don't do any lisp programming. Keyboard macros are a cool thing where you just type \n\nctrl-x (\n\nThen do a whole bunch of actual typing very carefully. Emacs will remember all of your keystrokes.\n\nctrl-x )\n\nThat remembers those keystrokes. Then you can repeat them all with\n\nctrl-x e\n\nYou can even do \n\nctrl-u <enter number>\n\nctrl-x e\n\nAnd it will execute the macro N times. Actually entering a number after ctrl-u will execute anything N times. It's just that ctrl-x e executes the macro you typed.\n\n> I think I've done literally one mass automated edit with Emacs, before I learned about sed -i. I think sed even has commands for doing an edit to n occurrences on lines j thru k.\n\nCool.", "is_submitter": true, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629734935.0, "parent_id": "t1_ha0bapp", "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"author": "SuddenProfile", "id": "h9cakwe", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #147", "submission": "p6dj7g", "stickied": false, "body": "I...
