Also, I just thought of something else:\n\nThere's a bunch of scientific evidence, which is taken much more seriously in Asian countries than in the West, that ventilation matters.  Severity of disease is known to be a function of the dose-response relationship, meaning more actual viruses in your body, the sicker you are.  Which means that, hypothetically, sitting in an enclosed space rebreathing your own exhaled SARS-CoV-2 could reinfect you, exacerbating the severity of your infection.  Try to get fresh air through your space as much as you can.\n\nI was reminded of this by the crack from your roommate about off living in a tent in the woods: that's actually good advice. :)  There was a study during the Spanish Flu that found that patients in the field hospitals (tents!) did much better than those indoors.  Now, that study is, far and away, the worst \"scientific\" study I have ever read that wasn't just based on falsified data, so take it with a grain of salt.  But the subsequent research into viral disease severity and the dose-response relationship in it gives that an extremely plausible mechanism of action.\n\nRelatedly, if you can assess and change the humidity of your space, try to get within 40%-60%.  You'll be more comfortable breathing, and it will help mitigate transmission, whether self-reinfection or to housemates.

I remember reading that article, and had lost track of it.  Thanks for the link!\n\nThe problem with that article, is that it takes a \"look at the wacky history people, not knowing real science like us moderns, thinking that fresh air has some magical property!\" tone.  \n\nI have... rather a lot to say about that.  I am a medical professional, and am in a weak sense a historian.  A huge amount of what has gone terribly in the US through this pandemic is directly traceable back to this terrible attitude towards the scientists and science of that time.\n\nFor instance, the six foot social distancing guideline?  It was debunked by two scientists about a month and a half (!!!) after the Spanish Flu broke out in the US.  They did a very clever experiment that proved that droplets adequate to infect if carrying an infectious agent travel more than10 feet from loud speech. Mere days after they published, health official here in Boston ran something in the Boston Globe telling everyone the new distance is 10 feet.\n\nSo when the CDC started promulgating the 6ft standard (the WHO did it too, two meters) in Jan 2020, I was like: WTF?  Did something happen to debunk the 1918 droplet dispersal paper?  How did we get back to 6 ft?  Apparently the answer is that a theoretical physics (!!) paper in the 1950s proposed that it was probably 6 ft, so everyone decided that was the most recent!cutting-edge!sciencey science and the right answer, and ignored the experimental finding from the ignorant old days of the early 20th century.\n\nThe reason the outcomes study was done on the tent hospital vs traditional hospital in the very first months of the 1918 pandemic was because the first people to come down with it in the US were men in the Navy, stationed in Boston, and bunked down on ships, and as they fell sick in great numbers with this terrifying new mystery illness, folks started noting that, apparently, the less well-ventilated a sailor's quarters were \u2013 the deeper into the ship they were quartered \u2013 the sicker they got.  So they decided to examine fresh air as a factor.\n\nI swear: this pandemic really is an IQ test, and it's not just the bleach drinkers who are flunking it.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628227501.0, "parent_id": "t1_h7wfmd1", "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"author": "exceptionaluser", "id": "h7tr18l", "score": 19, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #189", "submission": "oym0wh", "stickied": false, "body": "Try not to die. \n\nI've been told dying is put on your permanent record, and furthermore has possible negative consequences in career searching.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628181558.0, "parent_id": "t3_oym0wh", "replies": [{"author": "abraham1inco1n", "id": "h7tr8o4", "score": 9, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #100", "submission": "oym0wh", "stickied": false, "body": "Definitely not something you'd want to put on a CV.

The cannot for various reasons. What they do is to lower the probability of \n\n1. Catching Covid and getting ill enough to show symptoms\n2. Catching Covid and getting ill enough to spread it to others\n3. Catching Covid and getting seriously ill\n4. Catching Covid and dying.\n\nSure, this does not sounds like the panacea people were hoping for. And the probabilities for each of those are lowered by a different factor. But diseases in general and epidemics in particular have always been a probability game. If there is a high probability of catching a disease and getting seriously ill, then it's an epidemic or potentially even a pandemic and lots of people die. If there is a low probability of catching a disease and/or getting seriously ill, then it's just a nuisance, like getting the sniffles. And every percent less probability adds up and saves lives.\n\nVaccines have the power to make a highly infectious and deadly disease into a tame little cold. That's why we don't have measles epidemics ravaging through whole countries every couple of years anymore. (I encourage everyone to read up on the infectiousness, the etiopathology and the long term effects on mortality of measles if you don't know them already). That's why \"a cold\" is not a reason for grave concern anymore. People were dying like flies just a mere 50-60 years ago.
