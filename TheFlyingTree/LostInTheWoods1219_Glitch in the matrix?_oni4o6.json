Maybe this \"odd\" moment we temporarily experienced is actually \"reality\". A moment of system in the chaos we got so used to that we've been mistaking it for reality for so long^(2). We are basically damned to use our perception. Our brains are full of bias and deception so we never perceive reality but still have to trust our minds and senses because we have no choice. Our minds are not capable of comprehending another dimension or even reality. Can you imagine a color you've never seen before? No? Good. Proves that you're human.\n\nSome things we can't explain. We have theories and concepts for why things are like they are just for the sake of finding out who we are. Theology. Philosophy. Science. But these fields are, due to our perception, limited.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>!1 No, I'm not Vsauce.\n2 No, I'm also not Plato.!<", "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/oni4o6/glitch_in_the_matrix/", "id": "oni4o6", "author": "LostInTheWoods1219", "link_flair_text": "Idea", "num_comments": 15, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1626713786.0, "comments": [{"author": "Zealousideal_Mix_629", "id": "h5rvdqo", "score": 8, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #13 | Legio Virtus", "submission": "oni4o6", "stickied": false, "body": "What did you smoke, and did you bring enough for the entire class?", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1626715089.0, "parent_id": "t3_oni4o6", "replies": [{"author": "Cregaleus", "id": "h5rxj5d", "score": 3, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #290", "submission": "oni4o6", "stickied": false, "body": "Guess nobody told OP that he's supposed to read his psychology book, not smoke it.\n\nAssociative memory is consistent enough such that reproducible and predictable tests can be conducted. These \"glitch in the matrix\" phenomena are adequately explained by modern models of memory. It is common for the occurrence if a new stimuli to add new context to some past experience and yield an entirely new comprehension of that previously categorized experience.\n\nThere's nothing magical about this. If anyone finds this sort of thing interesting then they'd be better off opening a textbook on cognitive science than spreading unsubstantiated mysticism online.\n\nEdit:\n\nI shouldn't be so dismissive, there does seem to be some good philosophical observations in OP's post that are for whatever reason conflated with a claim on deja vu and other uncanny experiences. That our senses are imperfect instruments is a well explored idea within philosophy - do our senses give us any kind of correspondence with underlying truths, or can this all just be hallucinatory (the matrix)? If these sorts of questions interest you then I highly recommend reading up on Enlightenment philosophy, starting perhaps with Descartes.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1626715998.0, "parent_id": "t1_h5rvdqo", "replies": [{"author": "LostInTheWoods1219", "id": "h5s3ube", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "", "submission": "oni4o6", "stickied": false, "body": "I see.
