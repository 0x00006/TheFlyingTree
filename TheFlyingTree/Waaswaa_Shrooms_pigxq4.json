One is white and one is light orange-ish yellow on the top side of the cap, and both of them have these small \"spikes\" underneath.\n\nNo magic ones. Even though I still see the mushrooms when I close my eyes. Mostly yellowfoot. I think it's because I saw so many of them yesterday, both when picking, and when preparig them for the dryer. I think I spent probably 8-10 hours just dealing with mushrooms. So the image of them has burnt itself on my retina. It's just an interesting effect that I sometimes experience.", "is_submitter": true, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630870532.0, "parent_id": "t1_hbphs1q", "replies": []}]}]}
