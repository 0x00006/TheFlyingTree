In order finally control them, they had to be conquered militarily. Compare that to a disarmed population, which is already conquered *by default*, and totally at the mercy of whoever controls the military. As an example, Hong Kong was effectively a highly democratic city-state with great freedom of speech, until the PRC decided to take political control a couple years ago, and now journalists and elected politicians are being [imprisoned for merely speaking against the PRC](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/01/world/asia/hong-kong-prodemocracy-lawmakers-arrested-legco.html). Compare that to Taiwan, which China also claims ownership over, but has the distinction of being armed and capable of defending itself.\n\nYour point about crowd psychology ignores that different people respond differently to influence. In the US, the media are those crowd psychology experts, and trust in mass media is at [all-time lows](https://news.gallup.com/poll/321116/americans-remain-distrustful-mass-media.aspx). (Before you say \"Fox news\", distrusting mass media *does not* imply a respondent trusts Fox).\n\nAnother important fact is that self defense is not a simple majority rule situation, and mass manipulation would have to both win over *much more* than half the population *and* convince those it won over to be more willing to risk their lives maintaining the status quo than those wanting to fight back. This simply doesn't happen; even during the American Revolution, [at no point was support for the revolutionary war over 45%](https://www.rochester.edu/newscenter/three-things-you-didnt-know-about-the-american-revolution/).

Running a country successfully according to the government doesn't necessarily mean the people should be happy or \"free\". I do wish we had a better system, though.**\n\nThere's really no system of government that will make everyone living under it happy, but that's not really how a government measures success. Look at authoritarian communist regimes (yeah I know communism is an economic system, Leninism/Stalinism/Maoism/whatever-ism is the political system) for example. They aren't/weren't so great about allowing freedom of speech or dissent, to say the least, but they are great at building up power. The USSR (which collapsed in 1991, I know) was able to position themselves as a credible rival of the United States during the Cold War. China (I know they're kinda state capitalist now) was able to go from being underdeveloped and torn apart by warlords into one of the most powerful nations on the planet in a century. Living in the United States, it was difficult for me to understand why people support nations that aren't as \"free\" as my own. Aside from the whole being born there thing. For the USSR, it could be seen as a time where things were more secure and there was more \"respect\" given in the international community. For China the roads, dams, schools, and security are big things. The Reds built infrastructure and made the state more powerful in both cases. The West can say whatever they want, but did they build you roads? Or dams? If what you had before was a dirt path and constant flooding, maybe you'd be willing to overlook what it cost to get those things. If you ever find out. Governments don't stay in power just by stepping on people. They have to make just enough improvements to keep people from flipping out if they ever do learn about atrocities. As long as people can live in relative safety and have full stomachs, they can often accept anything. Then again, you can always just convince people that things would be worse any other way.\n\nTHAT BEING SAID the United States is pretty successful as the government is still able to keep stability and security throughout the nation.

I feel like this is an important one. How can one government, run 100s of millions of people? It becomes so chaotic, so difficult to allocate rescources, so easy to become corrupt, so easy to cause division as humanity/compassion lost when you're dealing with huge asf stats. \n\nIf a few million people were run by one government, there is a lot more room to hold those in power acountable as the impact of decisions is heard a lot more when there's less people actually. Biologically speaking humans were kinda only built to deal with around 200 ppl, so ofc shit becomes disconnected and you lose touch with population if its huge. \n\nAlso, another successful method would be to totally outlaw anything to do with tax evasion/avoidance. People say rich/big corps should pay more, I say they should pay what they already owe! that would be enough. I am tired of hearing about all these blatant abuse of loopholes, lawful evil is the worst evil imo. \n\nAnother thing, which i feel is ruining modern capitalist society is general unstustainable monetary growth. There's a lot moving parts to this issue, with links to the environment, people's livelyhood, inflation, common wallstreet practices, data grabbing and loss of privacy increasing, the list goes on but it all does kind of boil down to board members being pressured by share holders or any other body with a stake in question, to make more money/grow as an organised body contributing to the economy - and this simple instruction to make more money or move money around leads to 3rd world countries exploited and kept in the 3rd world, to people being refused a fair minimum wage, to oceans being polluted because certain companies want to cut corners and let their crap spill wherever because it's cheaper that way. \n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is, billionaires should be banned, pay your damn taxes, and there's no need to keep growing unstustainably just for the fuck of it and not giving a shit about the exponential distaster that ensues. Also our government should protect our privacy, not allow any corporation lobby for any fucked laws that just directly benefit them and the sociopaths who let such laws pass.\n\nThere's nothing wrong in principle (per say) with how government is run. It's more about the nature of man, and how the people at the top have sociopathic tendancies (which you could argue is how they got to the top in the first place). I guess it does just come back down to when countries get too big, it's very easy to be blindsided by all the crap your gov is letting happen, and how easy it is to be corrupt at such a huge level. \n\nAn example of a great, self-sufficient country that's not too big and most people there care a lot about politics and local government, is New Zeland. I've lived there, and the reason everyone loves it (apart from it being beautiful asf) is the very blatant community vibe you get. I feel people over there are in general very concerned with how their immediate community is run. Everyone is a lot more connected - by 2 degrees of seperation mind you.
