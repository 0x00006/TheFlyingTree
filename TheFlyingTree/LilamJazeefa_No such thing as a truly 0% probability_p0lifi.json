As such, we are *forced* to speak about the percentage errors incurred by models, and the probability that X model predicts accurately Y outcome of Z system T units of time in the future.\n\nSimilar reasoning goes to things like political outcome predictions (much closer to the original question).  It's not just too taxing to model elections down to individual voters.  It is *impossible* to model down to that scale because the systems are so chaotic that there couldn't possibly exist an algorithm, no matter how advanced, that could.  Things like the motions of weather patterns which could sway a voter's emotional state proximal to an election are tied to laws of physics which involve problems as complex as the three body problem.  Population dynamics and social interactions are also just as complex.  Even modelling the entire solar system down to individual elementary particles would only get you so far in terms of modelling elections.  Things like solar flares which can interfere with electronics and hence human communications are likely unpredictable as a rule.  Especially when you consider that such an algorithm would be run on a computer on Earth and its results would impact human interactions by virtue of being observed by humans.\n\nSo yeah.  We need statistics.  We need probabilities which represent more than currently-unsolved-but-solvable problems.  And this is evident in how politics are currently modelled.  Models are given confidence values based upon weighting of poll results based on respondant demographics.  Models are compared and assigned interrelated accuracy and precision scores.  Margins of error are calculated based upon respondant quantity, quality, and outcomes of previous election models compared to previous election predictions.  Individual voters are treated as black boxes and are divided into sample spaces and outcomes grouped into probability spaces with local and national geopolitical correlations.\n\nSo... about those odds of the Mongolian President being crowned absolute monarch of France tomorrow....", "is_submitter": true, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628477566.0, "parent_id": "t1_h88coug", "replies": [{"author": "Walking_the_Cascades", "id": "h88slgu", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #68", "submission": "p0lifi", "stickied": false, "body": "Well said!
