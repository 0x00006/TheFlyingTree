Remind yourself that your wellness affects your ability to give. That it\u2019s not selfish to take a step back and recharge. I can\u2019t speak to the reasons you devote so much of your time and energy to others, but I do want you to know that what you\u2019ve done is incredible. You are strong. You are brave. It makes perfect sense that you would be missed because you are valuable. \n\nMaybe what you need is a hiatus. Maybe you just need to do less. Don\u2019t let yourself feel guilty if what you\u2019ve been doing isn\u2019t feasible or healthy for you. Chances are, you\u2019ve been the one to pick up the slack when others aren\u2019t there to handle their own responsibilities. It\u2019s fair to let someone else take their turn. \n\nLastly, and maybe this doesn\u2019t apply to you, but it was a very valuable lesson to me so I\u2019ll take the chance and share it. Remember that it is you who teaches people how to treat you. If you find yourself frustrated that your \u201cacts of kindness\u201d quickly become expectations, or if you\u2019re tired of always being the one to sacrifice- you can change that. You can draw a line. Make a boundary. You deserve the kindness you so freely offer to everyone else. At first, people may be taken back by the change, but your relationships will become healthier. Which will be good for both you AND them. ..a few may not though. And I\u2019m almost certain there will be at least one of them. Someone taught you to concede yourself. That may be a relationship you need to distance yourself from. It\u2019s a lot to take in, I know. Therapy is fantastic resource that practically everyone can and should use. \n\nYou are brave. Breathe. Be well.
