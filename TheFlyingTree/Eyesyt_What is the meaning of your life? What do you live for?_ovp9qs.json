I\u2019ll even play nice and give you a helping hand by going first. \n\nA bit of a paraphrase (so feel free to attack - with evidence): Wittgenstein\u2019s point in Philosophical Investigations is that philosophical problems, specifically metaphysical ones (like the one we are discussing) are due to the way we inappropriately assign meaning to the logical structures of language. \n\nFor example: Mathematics can cope with a hierarchy of ideas to avoid Russell\u2019s Paradox but language cannot because we don\u2019t use language that way. \n\nThe result is that, if one believes Wittgenstein, metaphysics has meaning only in so much as there is \u201cexternal\u201d evidence. Of course external here is difficult to justify, but I\u2019d rather avoid a conversation about epistemology (Wittgenstein has much to say about how we know as it is the at the root of how we derive meaning). \n\nIn any case, if we are looking for external evidence then there is little more compelling than the fact that I can observe myself existing (because I think it is necessary to accept this fact to accept any other external physical evidence). I think is rather remarkable and this fact is enough for me to justify my continued existence. \n\nThat I find this remarkable is difficult to justify philosophically as I have no experience of any other kind of living. So feel free to attack that point too. \n\nThe above is what an opinion backed by evidence looks like.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1627860692.0, "parent_id": "t1_h7d6s8u", "replies": [{"author": "LoreleiOpine", "id": "h7dgxju", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #52", "submission": "ovp9qs", "stickied": false, "body": "> I\u2019ll even play nice and give you a helping hand by going first.\n\nYou already lost my interest, but now you're offending me.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1627864043.0, "parent_id": "t1_h7dapbc", "replies": [{"author": "vanillaandzombie", "id": "h7dhl2y", "score": 0, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #154", "submission": "ovp9qs", "stickied": false, "body": "I have to admit that was kind of my intention.

Unless this infantryman is a madman whose goal is to promote as much suffering as possible (in which case he is wrong/bad), he is *probably* fighting for what he believes to be a good cause. Think about what I mean by \"good\" there. I mean that he thinks that it is promoting wellness and preventing suffering in some important ways.
