I pole vaulted in high school. I was not very good, but I understand it and have personal experience with it.\n\nThe process of pole vaulting is the initial sprint in, lowering the far end of the pole into the \"box\" (the metal trapezoid depression at the base of the mat that catches the pole, continuing to run as the pole bends, leaping into the air (knee first!) past the end of the pole bend, and then riding the force of the pole righting itself up to the bar, fully inverting in the process, then up and over. The falling is the easy part.\n\nThe main problems with pole length are:\n\n1) You need to be able to bend it by running at it. If you don't bend it enough, you won't get close enough to the box to go straight vertical. The more it bends, the more energy it stores, but that requires a similar level of effort to push it into a bend\n\n2) A taller pole still needs to be firm enough to \"want\" to straighten out so that you get pushed vertically. The poles we used in HS (15-18 feet) were fiberglass. I presume olympic poles are similar. I've obviously never tried vaulting with a 35' pole before but I would strongly suspect that it either wouldn't want to straighten out fully (the weight of my body would be too much) or it wouldn't straighten out vertically\n\n3) Heights that high would be very dangerous. You can fall incorrectly from 18-20' high and be mildly injured (assuming you don't land on your head or neck -- which is possible since you have to fully invert on your way up!) but 30-40' could kill you.\n\n4) I don't have the math for this handy, but consider that the longer the pole, the longer the runway needs to be. Imagine that there is a curve that tracks runner speed as a function of distance -- should look like a curve of ln(x), flattening off at a point. You want the point where it flattens off to correspond with the moment the runner jams the pole in the box. The runner's has to continue running past that jamming point, but their speed is going to decline FAST. If you're jamming a 30' pole into the box, that means you have to be able to maintain your speed at LEAST another 10 or 15' before swinging into it (ref #1)", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628184090.0, "parent_id": "t3_oy9s45", "replies": [{"author": "Pleaseusesomelogic", "id": "h7u0skj", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #231", "submission": "oy9s45", "stickied": false, "body": "Thanks for your info.

Polevaulting is a rather obscure subset of an already obscure sport of track and field, so its completely understandable to not know. \n\n The latest technology jump was about 10-15 years ago when manufacturers came out with carbon fiber poles to use over fiberglass. (Before fiberglass the preferred material was wood or bamboo,  but i digress)\n\nFiberglass is softer and heavier,  which allows for more control and consistency during bending and unbending. Carbon fiber is lighter and stiffer and stronger, but this means that its harder to control. I used fiberglass mostly because carbon fiber poles were just too unpredictable. And when you're going 15', 16' or 20' in the air, unpredictable is the last thing any vaulter wants. Carbon fiber poles have been out for over a decade but it's only recently that athletes have gained enough confidence to use them consistently. And as such its only recently that a decades old world record has been broken with the newer carbon fiber poles. \n\nThe current technique has been honed and developed beyond what older poles allowed people to do. Thinking there is a better way to pole vault is more akin to asking for a technique better than the fosbury flop.\n\nAnd again to the length question, longer poles require more speed. More speed than what is already shown as possible by world class athletes. I dont know any vaulter that uses a 21' pole. And if they do. I doubt they hold it at the very end.
