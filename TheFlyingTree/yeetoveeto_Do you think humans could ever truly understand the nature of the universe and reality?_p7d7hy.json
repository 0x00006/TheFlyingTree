If a phenomenon has no effect in reality, how do you know it's there?\n\nIf some alien entity came down and claimed to have 'all the knowledge in existence', the only possible response is 'Prove it.' And I'd still remain unconvinced that it wasn't a party trick. \n\nI suspect that 'reality' is quite a lot simpler than most people make it out to be. This is why we have to invent all kinds of philosophies and religions to fill in what we see as gaps. \n\nAt the most fundamental level everything that happens is the dust settling out of the vacuum phase shift that was the big bang, and the transformation of potential energy into kinetic. \n\nThat it makes pretty and interesting patterns as it does so doesn't change what those patterns are at the lowest level.\n\nBut the fun part about the universe is that it has emergence, in that those interesting patterns can, with a shift of perspective, become the foundation for a different set of patterns themselves, and so on. \n\nThe problem with questions like 'the nature of the universe' or statements like 'all the knowledge' is that they do not account for incompatible paradigms or emergent phenomena. \n\nThe other thing is that 'all the knowledge' isn't going to be useful. Take, for example, the air in the room you are currently in. There exists a set of quantum information regarding the position and momentum of every single particle in the room. But what are you going to do with that? Far more useful would be the emergent properties of temperature and pressure and current. \n\nKnowledge by itself is just information, and information at its most simplified is literally just 'form'. (quantum information is not separate from the systems it describes. it IS those systems.) \n\nAt all levels, appropriate context is required to change 'form' into knowledge. Whether that is the shapes of ripples in the sand informing the shapes of the waves above them, or the alignment of carefully impure silicon crystals to hump electrical potentials around , if the alien tells us something we can test, then it's knowledge.\n\nIf we can't test it, and there's no way to tell whether it's true or not, then it's irrelevant.

Clarke's law and all that. But I find myself in the same position as I do on assertions of the supernatural. If there's a phenomenon, we can study it and understand it. Personally, I've always been a fan of the contrapositive to Clarke's Law: Any technology distinguishable from magic is insufficiently advanced. \n\n>I'm not sure if I miscommunicated, but I was intending the scenario that the future technology would be examined by experts, not laymen. Not that it makes much of a difference.\n\nAre you calling my great-grandfather a layman?! Have at thee, sirrah! Seriously though, my GG was a WWI pilot and then an engineer. But yes, I assumed the same thing. Experts, not lay people. But we shouldn't neglect that an expert is only an expert in their area of expertise. By your definition here we're dealing with technology that we don't already understand, therefore any expertise is the same as any other. Granted, throwing the world's best potato salad at it probably isn't going to make the alien gizmo work, but then again, who knows?\n\n>The possibilities are limited only by your imagination.\n\nMore practically, the possibilities will be limited by physics, biology, and the contingent history of the aliens in question. \n\nLook at human UIs. More less we've settled on some variation on the keyboard and mouse for most interfaces. Even touch interfaces are often skeuomorphic to the familiar layouts. Alternatives do exist, but they're niche or simply don't catch on. But the keyboards we all type on for most things are descended from their technological forebears in typewriters, and there's a semi-apocryphal story that the QWERTY layout was deliberately designed to slow typists down because they went so fast that the keys would jam up. (by separating common letters into opposite hands the keys would be able to more often strike true without jamming.)\n\nTouch screens themselves are keyed off of human biology, at least with some versions. They respond to the change that the human body adds to the circuit, (which is why some screens don't work with gloves). But a scaly lizard finger won't work a touch screen.\n\nThen think about the possible modalities of communication. We use electromagnetic (light) and acoustic (pressure wave in atmosphere) sensors for the vast majority of our interface outputs. But even on Earth there are lots of species that do other kinds of investigation and communication and interaction with their environments. \n\nWhat would a computer for a species that communicates with pheromones need for an interface?", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629512990.0, "parent_id": "t1_h9qjcyh", "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"author": "SybariteAussie", "id": "h9iujl5", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #177", "submission": "p7d7hy", "stickied": false, "body": "Perhaps we can construct a AI with the capacity?", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629374812.0, "parent_id": "t3_p7d7hy", "replies": [{"author": "yeetoveeto", "id": "h9j3944", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #62", "submission": "p7d7hy", "stickied": false, "body": "I'd say this would be our best bet currently, but that would entail having an ultra intelligence sorting out the math and actual heavy thinking of the theory and then just put into words for us.
