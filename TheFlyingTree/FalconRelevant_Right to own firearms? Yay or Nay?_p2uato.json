It baffles me why countries like the US allows the citizens to own firearms.\n\nIn my view, unless it is occupational, one should not be allowed any access to firearms. Now, that's my general  point of view, though in actuality, most laws would allow a person to own firearms under very strict licensing protocols, which I don't necessarily agree but its not sounding any alarms yet, not to me.\n\nI am not sure if what I have read is correct, that in the US, there's more than at least 120million guns owned by private citizens, and that 1 out of 3 Americans owns a gun. And amongst them, many own more than just one gun.\n\nMost gun owners will cite safety as a reason (let's just exclude \"because that's my right\" as a reason  because that's just saying I can be as stupid as I want to, and whilst that is correct, it's not contributing to anything at all in a progressive discussion, though I do know that handling this \"right\" in terms of an amendment to the Constitutional Law will bring out further discussional branches out there, which I also think is why Firearm Law in US is such a hot debate, simply because people are not able to isolate all these issues one by one and discuss their merits, but instead squeezes everything together, allowing so much chaos to exist within an discussion). \n\nI have digressed, but most gun owners will cite safety as an issue, but it seems that there is an issue of over owning guns, more than enough for personal protection. \n\nNow, what are they protecting themselves from, guns and other threats. For guns, the more guns there are in an environment, the more dangerous it is, and the more you need to protect yourself (I want to make a joke about how this contributes to an obesity issue, where I am eating as much as can to outlast another person who is eating to outlast me, and that we both got obese in the end and ended up dying even earlier than when we could have survived in this first place without this competition, and hence, this is America, which is of poor taste, I hope its treated just as a joke). I'm not too sure what \"other threats\" mean, I can think of robberies and people breaking in, which I think can be solved with advance alarms and strong tall fences, maybe things like window grills, surely, the money to own a firearm can be used for those instead, unless firearms are cheap in which case, that's just not right at all. Other threats perhaps also mean domestic issues (a violence from within a household), which I think is understandable, but I think there are also other ways to go about this, for now, this is the only strong point that I find supports a gun owning rights. Other threats like animals, should be handled by the government, instead of being justified as a reason to own a gun. As I am saying this, I am coming from a standing that gun is dangerous to begin with so the fewer the better. Instead of \"a gun is everyone's right and therefore we are discussin whether to uphold this right\" kinda standing. I am not listing it as a need to begin with wither.\n\nNow most of the threats so far are within or around a house, meaning to say the gun does not leave the house. \n\nWhen the threat is outside the house, I believe that is stage 2 of the discussion. Whether guns are allowed to be carried outside. And then comparing the list of threats and other alternatives, discuss whether there is such a need. \n\nHonestly, I don't think anyone would read this far, so I'm just stopping here.

How should people living in Alaska, or the northern parts of Canada handle wild animals? Should they just accept getting attacked, or only live in the areas the government chooses to let them live by providing police?\n\nMaybe in highly urban areas, this is reasonable.
