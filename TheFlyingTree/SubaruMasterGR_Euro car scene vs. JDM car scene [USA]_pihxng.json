As a car enthusiast, I really enjoy getting immersed in the enthusiast scene for each vehicle. Coming from a JDM machine, I've noticed that the Euro car scene skews a little older, a little more mature, but no less fun. There's still some wild modified cars to be seen; they're just a bit more subdued compared to their JDM rivals. Compare that to the JDM scene, where there's a lot of younger people who really use their cars as a canvas of self-expression. The modifications there can seem a bit Fast and Furious-y, but there's a great deal of passion there.\n\nMoving from the JDM scene to the Euro scene almost seems like natural progression.
