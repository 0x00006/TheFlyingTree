Generally they sit in a circle around the living room table and do a thing.  They all grab a bunch of small white rectangles in their hands, they start slamming them on the table and yelling.  Then one of them takes a small black rectangle.  This goes on for several hours.  I try going up to them and I purr and brush against their legs to try to get them to calm down.  They usually pet me for a bit which is nice but then they keep doing the loud thing so I smack them and run under the couch.\n\nI just want them to chill out because it's loud and makes me nervous.  I hate being on edge all the time but they keep doing it.  Also the sand in my litter box is different now and I don't like it at all and it's the same time when those other humans come over.  I'm just so upset and need answers.
