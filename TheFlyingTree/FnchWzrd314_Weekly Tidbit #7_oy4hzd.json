So let's say you take a picture of the sky in January, and then you take another picture in July.  The very far away stars are all in the same places.\n\nSome closer starts though?  They've moved a little bit.\n\nIf a star's apparent position moves by 2 arcseconds, that means it has a parallax angle of 1 arcsecond (definition of parallax angle), so it's 1 parsec away from us.  The only math involved from there is that it's a reciporcal.  So 0.1 arcseconds of parallax means it's 10 parsecs away.\n\nPhysicists have a tendency to make up units that mean they don't have to do math any more.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628129136.0, "parent_id": "t3_oy4hzd", "replies": [{"author": "KuriousKhemicals", "id": "h7rd2lm", "score": 4, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #106", "submission": "oy4hzd", "stickied": false, "body": ">Physicists have a tendency to make up units that mean they don't have to do math any more.\n\nhbar/2 has entered the chat", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628132070.0, "parent_id": "t1_h7r79nb", "replies": []}, {"author": "JanB1", "id": "h7rvfz7", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #136", "submission": "oy4hzd", "stickied": false, "body": "That was the question I was always asking myself.
