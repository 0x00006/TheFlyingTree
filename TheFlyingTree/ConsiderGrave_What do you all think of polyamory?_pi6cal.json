I don't think polyamory in the sense most people think of it is for most people, i.e. a person actively being in multiple romantic relationships at the same time with everyone involved knowing it. I've heard/read it said that men are not biologically made for monogamy, and I can probably see that being true...but that doesn't mean that they're made for--or want to have--multiple ***romantic relationships*** at once. Frankly, I think men just want to fuck different people, and that's different.\n\nI believe there's variety among us as to what's right for us, and, as I mentioned on another sub recently that was discussing \"giving up\" on dating/relationships, I think what's right for a lot of different people is already starting to be the norm. In the US, anyhow. What I see that being is a lot of people simply deciding they don't want to formally date/be in relationships or to get married for a variety of differing reasons, and that their \"relationships\" with people will be more about sexual satisfaction or not wanting to be alone as opposed to love and more traditional ideals/values like raising a family. I think true relationships and marriage are heading towards being essentially uncommon, not to say that's going to be the case 10 years from now...but eventually, with it being more and more so with each passing year.\n\nPersonally, I'm not happy about it. It has nothing to do with conforming to society. I, personally, would love to find one person--the ***right*** person--to be in a good relationship with and get married. But I also admit to something that I don't think a lot of people do, and that I think is a big part of the reason why we're moving away from relationships and marriage--I don't want to put the necessary effort, nor the necessary risk, in to find that person/relationship (and note: for me, it's the effort/risk to ***find***\\--for others, it's that...and for some, it's the effort to make relationships they find work). Part of it is I don't think everything I'd have to do--which is more than what the average person has to do--is worth it or would ***ultimately*** be worth it. I think this is where a lot of people are, or somewhere in the neighborhood.

If you can solve that with open communication, that seems better to me.\n\nThere is also something very freeing in realising everyone is their own person with their own needs and working on letting go of jealousy. It is a very unpleasant feeling and often unneccesary if you are in a stable and open relationship. You can also learn to let go of a lot of your jealousy.  \nA lot of jealousy we have is cultural. We grow these expectations about our partners from our suroundings and the media. You have to be everthing for your partner, fill every need, and they have to do that for you. But that does not seem feasible to me. You need multiple people in your life and it can be very rewarding to built deep relationships with others. You need that community.

Flat out. So, often what we think of as the 'right' way or even the 'wrong' way to have relationships is something we're trying to impose over the way that we've evolved, in order to allow ourselves to fit into the broader spectrum of our social group, or society. Thinking poly is the 'preferred' way to exist is just as much a lie, as thinking monogamy is--and anyone who's in a relationship with a person who prefers one over the other, trying to convince their partner who isnt--is trying to manipulate for personal advantage (its not abuse, always). That advantage may not be sexual, or financial at all--just, 'i prefer to live with the IMIAGE of this sort of relationship because it's easier/better to talk about at work' or something.   \n\n\nAs animals, we're serial monogamists. That's the evolutionary pressure, and general direction our species has taken.   \n\n\nAn odd way to think about this as confirmation, we have twice as many female ancestors as we do male ancestors--as humans. Serial monogamy gets that done. It doesnt even have to BE poly--two at the same time. Cheaters are inclined to stop having sex with their partners, in totality, in the period in which they cheat, and then resume later if it's stopped. they didnt do it simultaneously (unless pushed with a partner who didnt know), they do it in series, even if it's very brief series. A military spouse may only cheat for the 6 weeks their partner is in field training, and NEVER when they're around. Thats serial. I know an open poly relationship isnt cheating--and isnt directly comparable, but it's JUST as much as a forced and contrived sort of state as monogamy. If it wasnt, deep levels of communication, rules, and trust in those relationships wouldn't be required.   \n\n\nThe natural state, for the human animal, of both sexes, is serial monogamy.  \n\n\nThat's what i think.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630874182.0, "parent_id": "t3_pi6cal", "replies": []}, {"author": "TatianaAlena", "id": "hbr1bjr", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Druid #11", "submission": "pi6cal", "stickied": false, "body": "Not my thing.
