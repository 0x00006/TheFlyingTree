He said he didn't have any positions available then, but to send my resume and they would keep it on file. True to their word, I got a call from the hiring department asking if I was still available and interested!\n\nI've freelance edited for a few other gaming companies, including a one-shot Shadowrun adventure PDF for CGL, but this is my first time on the payroll of a major gaming company.\n\nI'm excited and elated and slightly terrified. Editing tabletop RPGs full-time is my dream career, and this is a huge step toward making that dream a reality.\n\nETA: D'oh, just noticed a typo in my post.

What I heard from somebody claiming to be a compatriot of both Eve and Steve Jackson was that the book was inspired by D&D gaming sessions with a group of evil alignment characters that they and a group of other friends played when they were teens/young adults.  I have no idea if the person I talked to actually knew Steve Jackson or Eve Forward, but it's a good story if it's true.\n\nEdit:  And of course to note, you are under no implied obligation to look into it.
