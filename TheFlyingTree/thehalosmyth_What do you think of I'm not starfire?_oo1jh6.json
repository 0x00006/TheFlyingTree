To be good at subversion, you need to understand and appreciate, even love, what you are subverting.\n\nThere is a crop of artists who neither understand nor appreciate what they are rebelling against. At best, they systematically slaughter the old thinking the new is better because it is different. The recent _Loki_ comes to mind. Episode 7 with respect to Solo comes to mind too. A good example of doing this right is Episode 8 (it is a great movie if you look at it not as a Star Wars movie but as a commentary about Star Wars and movies).\n\nWhen I see the picture and watch the trailer for \"I'm Not Starfire\", I stand with my mouth open in confusion. (For all I know, the actual material is great and only the trailer is awful.) The trailer should be called \"I'm A Raven Knockoff.\" A brass, overconfident boy would be a contrast to Starfire. Or someone formal, well-put together but rude. Or someone enthusiastic and can read a room.\n\nThe most common depiction of Starfire, from the various Teen Titan incarnations, is a kind, n\u00e4ive girl who is unsure of herself and has obligations beyond what she feels she is capable of. Newer animated series adds her being oblivious and awkward.\n\nStarfire's teen daughter who wears black and is put into a task she is unsure if she can accomplish _isn't_ another character.

Daughter of Starfire and high school outcast, Mandy is constantly trying to get out from under the shadow of her bright, bubbly, scantily clad, and famous mother. Dyeing her bright orange hair black and sticking close to her best friend, Lincoln, Mandy spends her days at school avoiding Teen Titans superfans and trying to hide her feelings for the gorgeous, popular, and perfect Claire. And while Mandy usually avoids spending too much time with her alien mother, she\u2019s been particularly quiet as she\u2019s keeping one major secret from her: Mandy walked out of her S.A.T.While Mandy continues to tell Lincoln her plans of moving to France to escape the family spotlight and not go to college, she secretly hides a fear of not knowing her identity outside of just being the daughter of a superhero and who she will become. But when she is partnered with Claire to work on a school project, their friendship develops into something more and a self-confidence unknown to Mandy begins to bloom. Claire seems to like Mandy for being Mandy, not the daughter of Starfire.But when someone from Starfire\u2019s past comes to disrupt Mandy\u2019s future, Mandy must finally make a choice: give up before the battle has even begun, or step into the unknown and risk everything. I Am Not Starfire is a story about mother-daughter relationships, embracing where you come from while finding your own identity, and learning to be unafraid of failing, if it was even failing in the first place", "is_submitter": true, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1626841025.0, "parent_id": "t1_h5y6wks", "replies": [{"author": "Theo0033", "id": "h5yrjce", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "", "submission": "oo1jh6", "stickied": false, "body": "That sounds cool.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1626842416.0, "parent_id": "t1_h5yp7pm", "replies": []}]}]}, {"author": "raedr7n", "id": "h60bhqq", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #49 | Legio Virtus", "submission": "oo1jh6", "stickied": false, "body": "The only thing I know about this is that the art style is horrendous.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1626878854.0, "parent_id": "t3_oo1jh6", "replies": []}]}
