You are either one or the other.  This is because a theist is a person that believes one or more gods actually exist, and an atheist is \"not a theist\" (that's what the a- prefix means).  So if you are not a theist, you are automatically an atheist.  It's worth noting that the theist/atheist label doesn't really address whether you think there *might* be a god, just what you actually believe.  Thus being \"undecided\" is typically an atheistic standpoint because you don't actually believe a god exists just that it might exist.\n\nThe gnostic/agnostic adjective modifies that to denote whether you think you can know (or alternatively whether it can be known) whether or not a god exists.  There is no such thing as a pure agnostic.\n\n[This article](http://web.archive.org/web/20120701054514/http://freethinker.co.uk/2009/09/25/8419/) goes into better detail and has a handy simple visual.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628144233.0, "parent_id": "t3_oya8r9", "replies": [{"author": "FuckinRiven", "id": "h7rzwr2", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #143", "submission": "oya8r9", "stickied": false, "body": "I have this information from Wikipedia which is really unprecise. \"Atheism, in the broadest sense, is an absence of belief in the existence of deities.

What a lot of people get caught on is that they believe that belief is a two state condition, but it is instead a three state one.\n\nFor a given claim X, you can\n\n1. Believe X is true.\n\n2. Believe X is false.\n\n3. Have no particular stance on whether X is true or false.\n\nThe easiest way to illustrate this is with a coin toss.  If I toss a coin but do not show you the result, and ask \"Do you believe the coin is heads up?\" the rational response is to hold position 3.  You know the coin has roughly a 50% chance of being heads up, but you have no compelling reason to hold that it is heads up.\n\nYou can extrapolate that to conditions with varying probabilities as well.  The lottery is another good example of this.  If you buy a lottery ticket, then while it is *conceivable* that you could win the lottery, you'd have to be very bad at statistics to believe it likely that you will win.  Most agnostic atheists are like this.  We may acknowledge that there is a chance that gods could exist, but we frequently assess the probability of that being very very low.\n\nWhere this applies to theism/atheism, is that for the claim \"At least one god exists\", theists are position 1, while both positions 2 and 3 are atheistic (because they're not theistic).\n\nBecause the English language can be imprecise at times, saying \"I don't believe in gods\" can often be interpreted as either position 2 or 3.  Thus there is often confusion about atheists as to whether they claim that gods don't exist, or that they merely don't believe that they do exist.\n\nTo further complicate matters, since there are many different definitions of gods, one can have a mix of gnostic/agnostic atheistic stances towards those definitions.  For instance, many gods of human religions are defined with mutually exclusive or contradictory traits.  It's entirely logical to hold a gnostic atheistic stance for those definitions on the grounds that they are logically impossible.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628149735.0, "parent_id": "t1_h7rzwr2", "replies": [{"author": "FuckinRiven", "id": "h7s4bff", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #143", "submission": "oya8r9", "stickied": false, "body": "Is the conclusion that some people confuse anti-theism with atheism?", "is_submitter": true, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628149992.0, "parent_id": "t1_h7s40j5", "replies": [{"author": "DoglessDyslexic", "id": "h7s4tt4", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #170", "submission": "oya8r9", "stickied": false, "body": "No, we haven't even discussed anti-theism.

Some atheists don't care a bit about whether people are theists or atheists.\n\nI personally am anti-religion, which is distinct from anti-theism in  that people with theistic beliefs do not necessarily belong to a religion (deists/panentheists for example typically are non-religious) and it is possible to be an atheist and a member of a non-theistic religion (such as some forms of Buddhism).

Briefly:\n\n>I know there is a god - gnostic theism\n\n>I assume there is a god - agnostic theism\n\n>I know there is no god - gnostic atheism\n\n>I assume there is no god - agnostic atheism\n\n>I don't know and I don't assume either option - agnosticism\n\nWhere did you get these definitions from? \n\nAgnostic/gnostic deals with knowledge \n\nAtheist/theist deals with belief \n\nWhere are you getting assume from? \n\nThese descriptions make it seem like you don't actually know what these words mean in that context. \n\n**Agnosticism** is a third leg to theist/atheist tripod that forces the \"god don't exist\" definition on atheists. Here is an example question/answers to figure out this rather **outdated** labeling system.\n\nDoes God exist?\n\nTheist- yes\n\nAtheist- no \n\nAgnostic (ism)- I don't know\n\nAlternatively, **agnostic** when used as a descriptor of theist/atheist does not force that belief of non-existence on the atheist. When these terms are used conjointly \n\nagnostic/gnostic- deals with claims about knowledge\n\natheist/theist- deals with claims about belief \n\nA few questions to help determine what label best suits you. \n\nDo you claim to have knowledge about the existence of god/s?\n\nDo you claim to have knowledge about the non-existence of god/s?\n\nDo you believe in the existence of god/s?\n\nDo you believe in the non-existence of god/s?", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628144496.0, "parent_id": "t3_oya8r9", "replies": [{"author": "FuckinRiven", "id": "h7rynth", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #143", "submission": "oya8r9", "stickied": false, "body": "Assume / believe was more of a translating mistake.\n\nAnswering your questions:\n\nI have no knowledge about existence of god/s.\n\nI have no knowledge about non-existence of god/s.\n\nI don't believe in the existence of god/s.\n\nI don't believe in the non-existence of god/s.", "is_submitter": true, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628145377.0, "parent_id": "t1_h7rxi8c", "replies": [{"author": "solongfish99", "id": "h7s0anw", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #183 | Classis Veritatus", "submission": "oya8r9", "stickied": false, "body": "The \"weak atheist\" position is commonly described as lack of belief in gods, which encompasses both \"I don't believe in the existence of god/s\" and \"I don't believe in the non-existence of god/s\" (lack of belief =/= belief that there is not).
