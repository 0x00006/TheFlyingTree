I'd imagine we're no longer on the galactic holonet primetime slot, except maybe on GBS.\n\nWhy do I think this?\n\nSimple.  I was military.  I was military, and I had a security clearance.  Did I see anything crazy?  Nope.  Did I read forbidden documents?  Nuh-uh.  I just very simply know that when you are granted a security clearance, unless something completely batshit crazy and utterly immoral happens, then 99.999% of people with a clearance are going to **shut up and keep quiet.**\n\nYou see, humans are absolutely *brilliant.*  \n\nJust look at Nikolai Tesla.  Albert Einstein.  Werner Heisenberg.  Aristotle, Pythagoras, Newton, Ford, any number of inventors, theorists, philosophers, doctors, chemists and more.  And this is just the people...\n\n...**who publish their work.**\n\nFor every inventor or scientist who publishes their work and makes their discoveries public, there are a dozen who *don't.*  And while most of the time, those people are delusional crackpots trying to turn lead into gold, there's going to be one or two geniuses who come up with something truly revolutionary.  Most of the time, that knowledge gets lost?  But sometimes it doesn't.  Sometimes it gets picked up and squirreled away.\n\nMaybe someone thinks it's worth something, or maybe it's just something really neat, but regardless, they personally lack the knowledge to understand what's going on?  But they have *enough* knowledge to know that **something** is going on, and they need to research what it is, and hang on to it for the future, when someone else figures out what's going on.\n\nThere are a *lot* of research vacuums out there, each developing in their own little spheres.  Sooner or later, those bubbles bump into one another, and amazing things happen.\n\nThat's where security clearances come into play.\n\nSome of those researchers are smart enough to realize that big government is a personal meal ticket.  They don't give a shit about society, they don't care about saving the world, they just know that BG is going to shovel gobs of money into their pockets, so long as they do their job and shut up.\n\nYou would be *astounded* to know just how many of that kind of self-interested scientists there are in the world.\n\nAnyway, they do their work, make discoveries, and **shut up.**  And BG squirrels their work away, even if they don't understand it?  Because there's always someone who *will* understand it, and continue their work, or even improve upon it.\n\nRemember Tesla?  He figured out all kind of crazy shit, but didn't know *why* it worked.  Flying machines powered by electromagnetism, ray guns, earthquake machines:  all very real, all true.  But because everyone lacked the understanding of the physics behind it, he was called a crackpot.\n\nBut see, now we *do* have the knowledge.  Now we *do* understand how that stuff works.  And because enough people kept their mouths shut over the centuries, we now have aircraft that look and act like UFOs from the movies, spooking the people and doing fucked up shit to cows.\n\nSo no.\n\nWe don't have aliens coming here to mess with our cows.\n\nIt's humans.

Saw man, MANY many UFO's.   \n\n\nDrove school bus out in this super dark, rural palace... and i took a monitor out there with me and she we got to talking about her faith, and how she didnt believe in UFO's or aliens and shit. I didnt say much, but i knew what i could see most mornings out there, in the bitch black skies (no streetlights for miles, no big city for 100+--SUPER dark). I say iv'e seen some UFO's, but leave it at that.   \n\n\nSo we get out to the turnaround, about 10 minutes early and she takes a step outside the bus to smoke, before we start the run. I step outside with her, even though i dont smoke, and was staring up at the sky, lookin for the things i KNEW were usually up there that scared me just a little. Then i saw one.   \n\n\nJust a bright dot--something you might think was a satellite, but not a plane, moving across the sky. So, i point up and say \"Hey, do you see that? What do you suppose that is?\" And she looked up and saw it, and she got excited and asked 'is it a satellite?\" My answer was \"Just wait.\"  \n\n\nAnd within a second or two, this thing that was moving in a straight line across the night's sky--turned. Like the shape of a J, an then stopped. Out of her mouth came \"Oh that's weird\" ... and then the thing that ALWAYS happened when one of those things did that, happened. Another one came in from like 120 degrees the other direction, and came to a stop right next to the first one. Her hand holding the cigarette fell to her side, and TOGETHER, these 2 lights, went off almost in the direction that the first one came from. from dead stop, to gliding across the sky together like twin satellites.   \n\n\nI looked over at her, this pious Christian lady that didnt believe in UFO's 5 minutes before, and she raised her cigg up, flicked the fire off it, and said \"Fuck that. Lets go.\"  \n\n\nI bust out laughing and started the route a little early, driving a little slow, and asked her what she thought about UFO's NOW--and she said that she's never going to talk about what she saw out there, that's scary, and some work of demons that we shouldn't have been observing.   \n\n\nShe NEVER rode my bus again. I would sometimes tease her if i saw her in the lobby, \"Hey Dianne, see anything interesting in the sky lately?\" and she'd usually just scowl, sometimes call me a dirty name. Worth it.   \n\n\nIDK what those things were. That makes them UFO's.   \n\n\nLife on other planets MUST exist. I'm positive of it, and gas spectrum analysis suggests that it's here in our solar system. Now, whether or not we'll ever know if other intelligent life exists, that's a different story. We all may be so rare, and so far apart, that it'll be impossible to ever contact each other. I think, it's possible, that we'll start sending satellites to distant solar systems within the next few hundred years, and INTEND for them to return. Like, light years. AI will make a trip like that possible, but still, it'll be hundreds of thousands, or million year trips, to get answers.

Most people saw a UFO in their lives, quite often even. Common people are generally unable to identify most flying objects they see. Even today I saw moving lights on the night sky and didn't know if it was a plane or a helicopter - it was an UFO, unidentified flying object. So yeah I believe in them.\n\nAliens - yes absolutely, a bunch of aliens recently came to my country seeking refuge after fleeing Afganistan. Not very hard to believe in them either.\n\nAs for extraterrestial lifeforms, they definitely do exist. To start with, there is a strain of microbe which evolved on the ISS - making it the first confirmed species which has only been encountered not on earth. Secondly there is a high chance that we have already committed forward contamination of Mars given that bacterial strains found in JPL clean rooms show traits helpful for survival in such conditions.\n\nAs for life originating on Earth - we don't know if our life originated on Earth. Like yeah sure, it's the main theory, but might as well been a single cell organism on an asteroid, who knows. That's there, but also more importantly, we know nothing of space. Like nothing. We have explored barely a percentage of Earth's own life, with majority of deep sea life and thousands of uncataloged species in Amazonia, and we already dare to claim that microbial life does not exist on Mars, Venus or for example Titan. As far as we know all of these planets in theory could support basic forms of life in some form (not necessarly carbon based). We have not explored them barely enough to be able to rule out that possibility.\n\nBare in mind that Earth hosts multicellurar organisms living as deep as 3.7km underground, so it's not impossible for Marsians to dwell deep underground around the ice caps (liquid water source). \n\nWe have seen nothing, we know nothing as a species. For the longest time we believed that our solar system was special, we thought most planets were gass giants and cold. Until a few years ago when we finally got decent enough looking glass to realize that smaller planets are incredibly common, and most stars actually have planets. So yeah, extraterrestial life is not a matter of belief for me, it's a fact.
