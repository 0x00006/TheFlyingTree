Mind blowing. \n\nAs little as 25 years ago, there was such a thing as long-distance calls. They would bill you by the minute depending on how far you were and how many exchanges it went to and so on and so on.  So I went to college 80 miles away from my home. Whenever I would call home I would be billed at $.32 per minute.  That\u2019s crazy.  If I remember correctly, long-distance charges started going away around 2000.  (I could look it up but I didn\u2019t.). \n\nAnd for you youngsters who have never even talked on a payphone, you would dial a number and they will tell you how many quarters to put in so you could talk for X amount of minutes. And then when you exceeded those minutes they would break in and say please deposit X quarters to continue talking.", "score": 40, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/oxinyf/facetime_video_chat_vs_long_distance_phone_calls/", "id": "oxinyf", "author": "Pleaseusesomelogic", "link_flair_text": "Fascinating", "num_comments": 64, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628043102.0, "comments": [{"author": "IonOtter", "id": "h7mvh6e", "score": 18, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #112", "submission": "oxinyf", "stickied": false, "body": "When I was in the Navy, I got assigned to the USS Reuben James, and we went on WestPac from December 96 to April 97.

I tried the DSN thing, and the base that was closest to home would not hookflash me, as it was still too far away.\n\nIn a flash of utter brilliance, I asked them to hookflash me to the AT&T *operator.*  That was a free call, so they did so.

The children were deliberately miscertified in order to misappropriate additional subsidies from the federal government. They are named for Maurice Duplessis, who served as Premier of Quebec for five non-consecutive terms between 1936 and 1959. The controversies associated with Duplessis, and particularly the corruption and abuse concerning the Duplessis orphans, have led to the popular historic conception of his term as Premier as La Grande Noirceur (\"The Great Darkness\") by its critics.  \n>  \n>The Duplessis Orphans have accused both the government of Quebec and the Roman Catholic Church of wrongdoing. The Catholic Church has denied involvement in the allegations, and disputes the claims of those seeking financial compensation for harm done.\\[2\\]\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplessis\\_Orphans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplessis_Orphans)\n\nThis attitude comes from the Catholic concept of the *mortification of the flesh*, the idea that pain and suffering \"perfects\" the human spirit and brings us closer to God.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortification\\_of\\_the\\_flesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortification_of_the_flesh)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-flagellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-flagellation)\n\nThe Catholic clergy who raised us believed sadism was acceptable behaviour that brought children closer to God.\n\nThe Marquis de Sade himself developed a pleasure response to pain, humiliation and sexual assault because he was beaten and tortured by Jesuit priests when he was a kid. The Catholic clergy abuse he experienced turned him into a LIFELONG serial rapist and abuser.
