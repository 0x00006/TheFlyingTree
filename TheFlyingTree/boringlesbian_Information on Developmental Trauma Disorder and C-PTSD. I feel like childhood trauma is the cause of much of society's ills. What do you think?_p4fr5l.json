The whole idea of \"inherited trauma\" sounds like some sort of eyeroll-worthy snowflake woo-woo bs until you look into the crazy amount of studies & evidence for its existence. Stress hormones are no joke, to the point they can alter bits of our DNA...which seems nuts! It certainly explains a whoooole lot about many traits & issues we humans have that are super counterproductive, yet persist under the heading of \"human nature\".\n\nI think the whole \"childhood trauma\" argument lines up perfectly with those findings as well. If you've got a good bit of inherited trauma to begin with then add a shitty/abusive/neglectful childhood on top of it...yikes. Y'know how people always try to say dumb shit like \"oh boohoo everyone's childhood was \"*traumatic*\", I got spanked but *I* turned out fine\" (*citation needed*) or whatnot...well maybe their childhood did kinda suck, but maybe also their grandparents weren't slaves/in Auschwitz/on the Trail of Tears/in the Cultural Revolution/in the famine in Bangladesh/colonized by wankers (that one's for you, Scotland!) & etc.\n\nOf even more importance tho, imo, is...& I realize this may make me sound like a dick but we're talking science so sociology counts...I think as the older generation dies off, & everyone left has lived the majority if not all of their lives with the whole of the world's collected knowledge at their fingertips, *hopefully* the closed-mindedness of society will lessen, significantly.
