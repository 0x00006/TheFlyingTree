The server was a West Marches style game set after RED\u2019s timeline but before Cyberpunk 2077.\n\nThere were inherent issues with this idea: For one thing a West Marches is inherently exploratory from what I understand, and adventure cannot happen in town whereas in Cyberpunk ALL the adventure happened in town. Second, lorewise it was clear the creator of the server clearly just played 2077 and included way more of that than any of the lore bits from RED. \n\nDespite that I was looking forward to playing. But I couldn\u2019t right away. The guy who created the server and others had no idea how to game master, least of all RED (which has very cluttered layout). So I agreed to be a GM/Moderator until they got stuff together. \n\nI ran a few modestly successful sessions and the creator ran part of a premade module. But then things got ugly quick. One of the people GMing was a bit of a nervous fellow and the creator and one other player began chastising him over how he ran his game and also something about his mental illness. This lead to him panicking and leaving the server (while removing stuff on our Roll20, effectively nuking our Cyberpunk tokens and maps at the time). After calming down and taking his meds the GM wanted to rejoin the server since he liked the community that was growing. The creator refused, thinking *he* was the asshole. \n\nWe ended up getting a mediator for this whole drama and resolved to include the GM back into the server but not as a GM, which he was fine with but it was clear the damage was done and he left not long after, the fun had been taken out for him.\n\nI eventually had another spat with the Creator about what game mechanics to include from Cyberpunk 2020 and he insisted including them without consulting the other mods and GMs under the pretense of it should be the players choice, which I called him out on privately. By this point I knew he was a budding authoritarian, tautological dickhead and made clear I would oppose him if I thought he was wrong. \n\nHe called it edgy bullshit at the time but what I said apparently made an impression on him because the next day he made me server owner. While shocked, I immediately began implementing the lore changes I had always want (with mod approval, I\u2019d look real silly if I went back on the whole democracy thing). I also tried running a game or two.\n\nHowever things fell apart. The issues I brought up in the beginning began to surface. The West Marches play style was not designed for an explored modern landscape like Night City and we also didn\u2019t have enough willing GMs.\n\nNot to mention I never wanted to GM, nevermind run an entire server, so the little time I spent was to try and automate the \u201cgigs\u201d players could try (that\u2019s another thing, adventures and gigs were GM posted/driven, not player driven like they\u2019re supposed to. In West Marches games players say they want to explore an activity in a certain place so the GM crafts up an adventure there and  along the way). \n\nI posted a table for people to roll up their own gigs....and that was it. The server died. No one messaged, I didn\u2019t message. The entire server stopped talking. Everyone was still there, but no one was engaged enough to make the first move with anyone. I\u2019m still in it, I can still see how still everything is, like seeing so many people in a room not saying anything. \n\nTl;dr: I joined a Cyberpunk West Marches game where the creator turned out to be a jerk who ruined our morale before throwing me the keys.
