I.e. after synthesis, they get incorporated into the cell membrane for lymphocytes to find, identify and produce antibodies against. Not only is it necessary that antigenes are anchored to the cell membrane (otherwise it would not be possible to predict and control which side of the antigen the lymphocytes latch onto and thus produce antibodies for), but it's also much easier than have them free floating, as most cells are equipped with pathways to embed proteins in their membrane but not to expel proteins into the surrounding fluid.\n\nOf course, with the death of the antigen producing cells, the proteins will get detached from the cell membrane and might end up in the lymph fluid and from there might end up in the blood stream. But this is highly unlikely as the way these cells die is by phagocytes eating them, which ultimately results in all their proteins being broken down.\n\nSure, we cannot ensure that no spike protein leaves the injection site, but the concentration elsewhere should be so low that it is inconsequential and quickly cleared up by the ensuing antibody production. With our current knowledge, it is actually far more likely (and for some of them we even have proofs) that the complications we have seen are caused by the immune system attacking healthy tissue. The exact cause for this is not known, but the guess seems to be that antibodies build against the spike protein latch onto the surface proteins of some cells (mostly vascular cells), which marks them as foreign elements, to be eliminated by the immune system. I.e. it is kind of an infection mediated auto-immune disease. I write infection mediated, because the same happens with a Covid infection as well and is not unique do the vaccines.

I've been the one taking her to get shots for years now, because I'm good with helping her manage her phobia. Her mother and sisters, not so much.\n\nShe got so worked up, we had to go to a \"private room\" and she had to lay down. She was bouncing between sobs and laughing and it was quite the ordeal.\n\nFor the second shot, the family still came along but had very clear instructions not to ask her how she was doing, not to talk about, etc. Just a matter-of-fact situation, she'll sit down, the shot goes in, and we're done. It was still difficult for her, I could tell she was doing internal sommersaults (like always), but she got through it.\n\nSo, anyway, phobias are (by definition) not rational. However, you can do some rational things to help get through them. For needle phobia, it's particularly relevant because the reality is that getting a shot is a very minor incident. I've had stubbed toes that hurt worse. So, you've just got to manage your stress level going in. If you have a favorite beverage, have it with you. If you have a favorite dessert, tell yourself you'll have it afterwards... but try to frame it in your mind as just a \"good day\" full of stuff you like.\n\nLastly, meditation and breathing exercises are a huge help as well. Phobias trigger a fight-or-flight response in our sympathetic nervous system, so practicing calming both the physical and mental aspects that you ***can*** control will really help when the parts you can't control start to rev up. \n\nTo meditate, simply sit quietly for a few minutes. Close your eyes and breath deeply, and try to focus on the breathing. The goal isn't to have \"no thoughts,\" but what you do want to do is when a thought comes up that isn't about your breathing (and it will), tell yourself \"nah man, I'm good\" and let it pass. Kinda like when you're taking a test and you have to zone out bullshit so you can focus, except instead of focusing on answering questions you're simply focusing on breathing in and out. Each time a thought comes in about something new, do your best to shoo it away. You only need to do this for a *few minutes* a day (I usually just do it in the shower), but what it does is teaches you how to \"shoo away\" thoughts that you don't like more easily. So, when you're thinking \"oh fuck oh fuck needle needle needle shit\" you'll be more equipped to be like \"nah, fuck all that, breath in breath out breath in breath out.\"\n\nHope this helps you, or someone else in some way.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630516098.0, "parent_id": "t3_pfxy9f", "replies": [{"author": "PurpleDevilR", "id": "hb7ng6c", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #18 | Ordo Cognitus", "submission": "pfxy9f", "stickied": false, "body": "Luckily my mother knew not to go on about it.\n\nI think lying down is standard procedure for Needle-Phobia, it\u2019s the first thing they asked if I wanted to do.

It's like the index example of what benzos are for, clinically speaking.\n\nThe problem is that your \"philosophy\" is precisely the logic that leads to addiction and gets addicts in trouble.  See, the problem with benzos is that they seem, especially to lay people who don't really see the same distinctions benzo-savvy mental health clinicians do, to solve a lot of problems they really, *really* aren't safe to use to solve.\n\nA lot of people have a lot of things they fear in life, so when they take a drug that, as you say, makes you nearly immune to fear for about three to six hours (or more or less depending on which benzo), they naturally think, \"well, shit, this is *great*, I'm not afraid of what the mean kids at school are saying about me, I'm not afraid that my boss will yell at me, I'm not afraid I won't be able to pay all my bills; I have a lot of other fears in my life that are also a problem for me, and if there's a drug that magically solves the problem... why not use it?\"\n\nBenzodiazepines are for TEMPORARY terrors, where you have to get through a singular, stand-alone, fear-inducing TIME LIMITED experience.  If the thing that you are afraid of is still going on when the benzo wears off, THAT IS DANGEROUS.  That's how addictions start.  The scary thing has to be over and done with when the benzo wears off, OR YOUR NEUROCHEMISTRY WILL START TO CHANGE.  In the bad ways.  The dangerous ways.\n\nSo fears about ongoing problems in one's life are TERRIBLE candidates for benzodiazepine treatment.
