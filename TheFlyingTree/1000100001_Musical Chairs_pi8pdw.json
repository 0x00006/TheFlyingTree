It\u00a0should be noted that I have\u00a0never played this outside of an academic setting. \u00a0I have some fond memories but now, I feel the need to do further research on the matter.\u00a0", "is_submitter": true, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630886443.0, "parent_id": "t1_hboc71p", "replies": []}]}]}
