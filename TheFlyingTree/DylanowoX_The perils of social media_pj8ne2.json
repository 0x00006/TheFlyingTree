Then when you get to other stuff like TikTok, I barely know what they are.\n\nThe positive to Facebook is it gives me a way to have people I knew back in school at my fingertips if I ever want to reach out to them or see what's up with them. I don't have to rely on phone numbers that change. Aside from that, FB is far too share-y for me. I don't know about now since I don't use it at all now and just simply have an account, but in the past it gave way too much info as a default/against your will and also encouraged this with all of this \"So and so was at xyz restaurant\" type of info. My friends and I used to joke that it was going to start updating everyone whenever we went to the restroom at some point. And people do too much faux flossing on it, just trying really hard to show off or present a positive image of their life.\n\nTwitter is something I don't see the point of. Like, for me, I've basically tweeted to thin air when I used it. People who get a following, I have no idea how they do that. I could easily go on and tweet \"controversial\" opinions about politics and sports, but I don't know if that would get me followers, unless maybe I put half-naked images on my Twitter account. Then again, if I had to do all of that to get followers, then I can imagine losing a job over it at some point. I also just think something is wrong with thinking people care about my opinions to the degree that I'm going to go on Twitter on a regular basis and tweet them to a bunch of followers or to get more followers. Like, my thoughts matter no more than anyone else's, so I keep them to myself until they're solicited. For lack of a better word, many regular Twitter users seem self-important, and their followers encourage that mentality. \n\nInstagram is another one like Twitter, like, how do you get followers without being half-naked? No point for me whatsoever. That's why there are so many \"Instagram models.\"\n\nI will say--a lot of people on Reddit trash LinkedIn and that's social media to some people...to me, it's the best social media, if you consider it social media. It has been huge for my career and salary, and it has helped boost my self-esteem when it comes to my career and feeling imposter syndrome.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630964193.0, "parent_id": "t3_pj8ne2", "replies": [{"author": "DylanowoX", "id": "hbvbs40", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #10", "submission": "pj8ne2", "stickied": false, "body": "Oh, I see\u2026 very informative.

It is also filled with boomers and people post drama stuff on there often, which is why I stopped using it.\n\nTiktok is just funny videos and comment sections aren't important, much like instagram. You can quickly curate what content you want to see and avoid influencers or those dance videos, so it's cool in my books, it is just like vine. The same can be said for instagram, although I do not use it, you can pick who you want to susbcribe to.\n\nTwitter, unfortunately, is the worst. Your offhand tweet can get some random person offended and then get swarmed with negativity, and anyone can see anything you post (unless it is like a followers only type of thing). It's good for keeping tabs on news headlines and announcements and stuff, but time and time again someone will say something somewhat controversial or stupid and get mobbed. Like a joke about being gay (when you yourself are gay) will get misinterpreted as people seek clout and sic their followers on you. For example, a lead AI engineer at Google said that machine learning models are not inherently biased and the problem often arises from the training and dataset used and they got driven off Twitter entirely by \"activists\".", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630964644.0, "parent_id": "t3_pj8ne2", "replies": [{"author": "DylanowoX", "id": "hbvc0ue", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #10", "submission": "pj8ne2", "stickied": false, "body": "Oh man, Twitter sounds fucking horrible.", "is_submitter": true, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630972616.0, "parent_id": "t1_hbuvo51", "replies": []}]}, {"author": "Smaug_themighty", "id": "hbux7h1", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #499", "submission": "pj8ne2", "stickied": false, "body": "To me, worse than it being a waste of time is the fact that people tend to get influenced heavily by social media.

This is a great topic. Thank you for this. \n\nI just wanna say some stuff real quick.  \n\nI cannot stand TikTok. I tried. But I deleted it within the same hour. It\u2019s loud, there\u2019s too much stimulation for me. It\u2019s abrupt, it\u2019s bright, it\u2019s extremely nonsensical. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong I like funny shit (or what I find to be funny) but I personally find most of the shit on TikTok that I come across INADVERTENTLY to be very fucking stupid and infuriating. Although there are some interesting things. Very few to me, I don\u2019t stick around or search of that. I don\u2019t want to be on it. \n\nLike most things I try to take it with a grand of salt. But I hate it. And avoid it. It\u2019s so bad to me cause it advocates stupidity the most, probably up there with FB imo. TikTok creates this culture of pick me, and look at me, and w/e. Shit idk that\u2019s how I feel lmao. \n\nI\u2019m sorry but I can\u2019t find anything good about TikTok. There\u2019s probably one thing maybe. And tbh I don\u2019t want to search for it lol. That app..it\u2019s repulsive to me. \n\nIG: I like fashion and art and shit so it\u2019s cool for that to a certain extent. To find new artists, and new ways of doing things, new clothes (vintage or new), and speak with people irl who are most likely to respond to dms rather than their phones. \n\nI like to post what I find interesting or what catches my eye when I\u2019m out and about. But I don\u2019t go out much lol. And No selfies or pictures of people I know irl. I don\u2019t post as much. And I hate how I FEEL like I need to make it look good. There\u2019s this incessant to make it \u201clook good\u201d. Structure and shit. I\u2019m sick of that shit. I\u2019m over it. I don\u2019t like feeling that way. \n\nI private and public. Deactivate and delete. I have a real like and hate relationship with social media in general. It doesn\u2019t stimulate me in the way that I need. It just looks nice. Good for passing the time, to a certain extent. \n\nThe reels on IG (like tiktok) are a bit annoying. I tend to avoid them. The Explore page is cluttered and riddled with shit, mini screens of shit everywhere. But it\u2019s a lot more tolerable to me than tiktok. Cause I CAN GET OUT OF IT. It\u2019s not the sole purpose of the app. \n\nWhat I dislike about IG is that \u2026fuck idk, people seem way too full of themselves. It reeks of facades, people are very performative, seemingly shallow, stealing ideas, all for likes, for shares, for the fuck of it. Idk. Too many carbon copies of each other, the way some of them think, act, move. I find it a bit eerie and off putting. \n\nIt just seems that way to me and it irritates me. Makes me feel inadequate, confused, and it can be discouraging at times from an artistic perspective. And life for that matter. Perhaps it\u2019s all in my head? Haha. \n\nBut art, photography, and fashion\u2026so I stick around. Although I deleted the app weeks ago. \n\nOnly on Reddit right now. I like it. I can talk about shit that I feel I can\u2019t talk about on my IG stories. I can do that here. \n\nI guess idk that\u2019s all I can say. A generic answer for the good would be: make connections with people and find new things. \n\nThat\u2019s it.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630965862.0, "parent_id": "t3_pj8ne2", "replies": []}, {"author": "Kelyaan", "id": "hbviwmi", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #271 | Consortii Concordus", "submission": "pj8ne2", "stickied": false, "body": "I've just got rid of my last social traditional social media.  \n\n\nTwitter is a shit hole that really puts a taint on humanity.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630976024.0, "parent_id": "t3_pj8ne2", "replies": []}, {"author": "naivenb1305", "id": "hbw1ye3", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #561", "submission": "pj8ne2", "stickied": false, "body": "It's addictive; you know that each karma pt/ retweet is done by an irl person who likes your content.
