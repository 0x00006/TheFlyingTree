Less than 0.001% died from the disease.\n\nThis article is an analysis of the situation in the U.S. where certain politicians have actually politicized the vaccine for their own political gain. As a result, millions of people would quite literally rather die than get the vaccine.\n\nThe article discusses multiple cases of regrets that people feel about not having been vaccinated or about their deceased loved ones not having been vaccinated.\n\n##**My Own Opinions**\n\nIt's easy to think that at this point in the U.S., COVID is acting as a form of natural selection.\n\nBut, the fact is that not getting vaccinated when it is available to you should be considered in the same light as drunk driving. It is an action (or perhaps an inaction) that willfully and deliberately puts oneself *and many other people* at needless risk of severe illness, death, or very long term or permanent consequences including brain damage.\n\nAnd, the results are not limited to oneself. Those who choose not to get a free vaccine that can prevent all of this in the overwhelming majority of cases are also becoming incubators for the virus. They are quite literally helping COVID itself to mutate into new variants. They are spreading the disease to those who cannot be vaccinated, such as children and those with compromised immune systems. If the results of not being vaccinated were merely that the person opposed to vaccines put themselves at risk, I honestly wouldn't have much sympathy or concern. One has a right to choose to die or be debilitated in this way. \n\nOnce it puts others at risk, it is no longer a victimless act to choose not to get vaccinated.\n\n##**Under-reported COVID Health Risks**\n\n**Long COVID or Long-haul COVID**\n\nOne of the things under-reported in this pandemic is the number of long COVID cases (or as we say in the U.S. call COVID long-haulers, an expression from the interstate trucking industry).\n\n[Mayo Clinic: COVID-19 (coronavirus): Long-term effects](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-long-term-effects/art-20490351)\n\n[CDC: Long-Term Effects](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/long-term-effects.html)\n\n**Permanent Brain Damage, Even for Young Healthy People**\n\nIn addition to the fact that even young healthy people who get COVID do have a significant risk of death, the actual effects can be even worse than the long, drawn out, painful death.\n\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic article above:\n\n> **Even in young people, COVID-19 can cause strokes, seizures and Guillain-Barre syndrome \u2014 a condition that causes temporary paralysis. COVID-19 may also increase the risk of developing Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.**\n\n[BBC: How Covid-19 can damage the brain](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200622-the-long-term-effects-of-covid-19-infection)\n\nFrom the article (emphasis mine):\n\n> Now, more than 300 studies from around the world have found a prevalence of neurological abnormalities in Covid-19 patients, including mild symptoms like headaches, loss of smell (anosmia) and tingling sensations (arcoparasthesia), up to more *severe outcomes such as aphasia (inability to speak), strokes and seizures*. This is in addition to recent findings that the virus, which has been largely considered to be a respiratory disease, *can also wreak havoc on the kidneys, liver, heart, and just about every organ system in the body*.\n\n**Additional Reading About COVID Brain Damage**\n\nSome more articles on the subject of permanent brain damage, *including in young people who had mild cases of COVID*.\n\n[Brain Damage And Hallucinations Associated With Even Mild Covid-19 Coronavirus Infection](https://www.forbes.com/sites/victoriaforster/2020/07/08/brain-damage-and-hallucinations-associated-with-even-mild-covid-19-coronavirus-infection/?sh=4a3d55fe6d91)\n\n[Serious Cases of Brain Damage Are Linked to COVID-19](https://www.sciencealert.com/serious-cases-of-brain-damage-are-on-the-rise-and-covid-19-seems-to-be-behind-it)\n\n[From \u2018brain fog\u2019 to heart damage, COVID-19\u2019s lingering problems alarm scientists](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/07/brain-fog-heart-damage-covid-19-s-lingering-problems-alarm-scientists)", "score": 61, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/owyzgk/if_you_are_eligible_for_the_covid_vaccine_in_a/", "id": "owyzgk", "author": "MisanthropicScott", "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "num_comments": 143, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1627978636.0, "comments": [{"author": "BuccaneerRex", "id": "h7jsith", "score": 14, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #96", "submission": "owyzgk", "stickied": false, "body": "Got the 2nd dose in April. Each dose made me a bit groggy and achy. In both cases rest and fluids made me fine the next day.\n\nPeople think of COVID as a respiratory disease because that's how you catch it. But it's an epithelial virus. It infects the cells that make your soft tissues. Which is why it screws so many different body systems six ways to sunday.\n\nIt does this using the famous spike protein, which is sort of the virus equivalent of using a lightsaber to pick a luggage lock.  The spike binds to a receptor on the cell's surface, and then shoves its way in causing damage. The cell then gets hijacked in the usual virus way, spitting out millions of virus bits that then self-assemble into new viruses. Your immune system just attacks all the stuff, and in a lot of cases that's what kills you. \n\nSo what does the vaccine do? The basic concept is that by giving you something to train your immune system, you will fight off the infection much faster, since you don't have to wait for your body to learn the virus. The first vaccines did this by infecting you with a weaker viral relative. By learning to fight cowpox, people could defeat smallpox as well. With later vaccines we learned first to kill the virus, basically grinding it up and injecting it so the immune system can learn to recognize by the bits and bobs, and we learned to weaken viruses, so that the body could learn to fight by recognizing a whole virus.\n\nIn both of those cases though, it was more or less a crapshoot as to which bits your body would learn to recognize. They worked, but  they're not perfect. Even with weakened or killed viruses, there could be a chance that enough genetic material would remain to cause a small infection. \n\nSo what's different with the mRNA vaccines? mRNA is the molecule that your cells use to create proteins. Your body gives no fucks what proteins it makes, it just grabs the nearest molecule and starts printing. This, of course, is how viruses themselves work. They get inside your cell and jizz their RNA all over, and your body grabs it and starts cranking out new virus bits that self-assemble and make new viruses, which burst out of your cell like Aliens and then go on to infect new cells.\n\nOlder vaccines were a shotgun approach because we never know exactly what antibodies will be generated, and whether that will be a useful target for the immune system.\n\nBut the new vaccine is MADE of mRNA, specifically it's a set of instructions for making the spike protein. And nothing else. So when this mRNA is taken into your cells, and your cells start cranking out spike proteins, your body learns very quickly and strongly how to recognize and fight those exact proteins.\n\nAnd since there's no other viral RNA to get copied, the only thing that gets made are the spikes. Which are harmless if not part of a virus. And they seem to be the parts of the virus which are most similar between variants, which is why the mRNA vaccines still seem effective against Delta and Lambda. \n\nDoes a vaccine protect you perfectly? No, of course not. It's part of a biological system, and biology is messy. When you get a viral infection, there are several stages, and it's important to think about each one. There's exposure, where the viruses get inside you. The more viruses you're exposed to, the higher the chance that some of them will manage to get into some of your cells. Exposure happens through droplet exchange for the most part. Little tiny bits of moisture in the air that carry viruses with them. This is why masking is important. Even crappy masks will catch some of the droplets, and a lot MORE of them on the way out. \n\nVaccination does not prevent you from being exposed, obviously.\n\nOnce exposed, meaning you have living viruses inside you, a few things can happen depending on your own history and health. \nCould be your immune system just wipes the floor with the virus. \nCould be the virus starts replicating but doesn't get much of a foothold in enough cells to cause damage (asymptomatic, you can still expose other people). Or you could get a range of symptoms from mild on up to terminal, depending on your immune response and viral load. \n\nBut if your immune system already knows the spike protein, you're much more likely to fight it off at that first stage. Being vaccinated does not mean viruses bounce off of you. You can still be exposed, and you can still have viruses infect and kill your cells and make new viruses, and you can still shed viruses and expose other people. It's just that your body will be MUCH better and faster and more efficient at fighting it, so much so that most vaccinated people will never know they were exposed. \n\nThe mRNA vaccine is really a wonderful and amazing tool, as it allows us to specifically target the most critical parts of the virus. It's the spike proteins that give the family of viruses the name 'Corona', because they look like a crown. If the old vaccines were a shotgun held by an angry homeowner, this is a sniper rifle held by a Finnish skier. \n\nThe goal is to get your immune system to recognize the virus. Your body has a 4 billion year head start on fighting viruses, so the most efficient way to fight viruses is just to tell the immune system exactly what we're looking for. We know how to do that now. \n\nIt also should go without saying that at no point will any microchips be injected into you. I'm happy to expound on the many, many ways in which this is not a concern. \n\nI can do the same for 5G.

Even biology disciplines are wildly differing areas of focus.\n\n>but I believe the old-fashioned, or traditional vaccines would be a better choice\n\nWe've got data for both in the US. Anecdotally, it looks like both types of vaccine provide better than 90% protection, with traditional vaccines seeming to be less efficacious against newer variants. \n\nFrom a purely speculative standpoint, I'd suggest that the mRNA vaccine would be more efficient. There are multiple antigens that could be targeted by antibodies for immune response in a case of natural or inactivated vaccine immunity. Any of these can mutate, and are more likely to mutate than the spike protein itself, which is fairly similar across a lot of this type of Coronavirus. \n\nThink of it like a customs checkpoint. All the bad guys wear red hats, but if the instructions tell people to check for blue left shoes and ignore the hats, then the bad guys get through. but because the first few bad guys your body caught had blue left shoes, everyone got focused on that. Or orange right sock. Or lime green shirt. But since it's the hats that cause the problem, and they all share the hat, a targeted recognition campaign is more useful.\n\nAlso, it's mRNA. it's the same stuff your body uses to generate its own proteins, and it's the same stuff the virus injects into your cells to trick your body into making the virus's proteins instead. \n\nWe know that it doesn't stick around after being used, or normal genetic expression wouldn't work as it does. \n\nSo it's like sending your body the 3d printer files to make perfect copies of the red hats, except without the terrorist attached to it. Thus your body can recognize terrorists by their red hats, instead of being distracted by extraneous antigenic details.\n\nNow that we're learning how to target specific proteins with their mRNA coding, we can do other things like get your body to recognize cancer cells and attack and kill them. Right now cancer gets by because your body doesn't recognize it as an attacker. (It's a bit more complicated, but cancer is your own cells, so it's hard to spot.) But if a vaccine can teach your body the specific ways that cancer cells change from the normal, the immune system can learn to fight it.\n\nand that's something that would not have been possible with traditional vaccines.\n\nBut any vaccine is better than none.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628014155.0, "parent_id": "t1_h7ks6o7", "replies": []}, {"author": "KuriousKhemicals", "id": "h7ltmbv", "score": 4, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #106", "submission": "owyzgk", "stickied": false, "body": "Well, most countries have either Janssen or AstraZeneca.
