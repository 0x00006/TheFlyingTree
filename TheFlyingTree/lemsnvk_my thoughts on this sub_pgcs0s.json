(I quote you: *the need to want to be part of something (because it is comforting)*) all of this being driven by the rank system, and supported by the length of existence that the community has -which is not much tho it hasn\u00b4t even been a year-. But if this continues and the filters to be part of it become even more strict and accurate, the idea of a \"secret and exclusive\" sort of weeb elitist sub could lead this somewhere.\n\nFor now, I\u00b4ll remain here as long as possible just to see how this goes.
