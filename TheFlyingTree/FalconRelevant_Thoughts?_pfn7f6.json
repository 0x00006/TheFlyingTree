And pro-mrna vax for most people. No for children and pregnant people and people who are one fever away from death or complications. \n\nThe problem with this is that the fact that long term studies on this vax type aren't that common. There are a few on ebola and some cancers. But even those aren't that old. I am sure enough that my safety won't be compromised for the next 10 years. But longer term I don't know. There don't seem to be problems there. The next generation won't be impacted by childhood disease caused by the vaccine. And that is data before politicization of the vaccine thing. \n\nThere are some changes to blood cells, but that seems to be a covid thing in general. So if it causes problems covid most likely would have killed you.\n\n There is also the problem of hospitals being overrun in some places and nurses can bbe held accountable for mistakes caused during overflow and there are only a certain number of beds they can service lawfully. And data shows... \n\nThere also is the worsening of mental illness due to lock downs. Suicide attempts have been up, but weirdly enough successful suicides have stayed the same. Also abuse victims cannot get away from abusers sometimes because of lock downs.\n\nAnti body test isn't enough proof of having had covid. To only get one dose of vaccine. There might be reasons why, but you know that still seems stupid.\n\nThis seems like a perfect storm to freak people out. And the more uneducated, but intellectual people who are naturally more anxious will justify their feeling of unease with what is going on and they will talk and look into the politics around the vaccine and draw parallels. They see censorship and the alarm bells go off. They see the lock downs. They see the agression. They see the tracking. And green passes. And holly berries I can't blame them. \n\nStupider people look at these distrustful smarter people and take their opinions as their own. They are afraid and anxious and depraved of human contact and the fear has nowhere to go.

Pregnant I haven't found data on mrna long term effects on children born to mothers who were vaccinated while pregnant. Short term everything is more than good. The outcomes to mothers who get covid while pregnant carries higher risks for birth complications. The current cdc recommendations are for it. The weighted risks come out positive. I am okayish with it, but more than that I believe that, ideally every one around them would be vaccinated and that there should not be a need to deal with unknown.\n\nNeutural and a bit horrified for sickly people-Fever is a common enough side effect that people aren't worried about it.
