I've got all my music files saved to a server on my LAN. It's hooked up to the stereo and runs the [music playback daemon](https://www.musicpd.org/), so any computer or phone in the house can cue up music on the stereo remotely. It also hosts everything over http and smb, so you can listen with headphones from other devices. Aaaaaaand it shows up as a bluetooth speaker or airplay speakers so you can stream YouTube or podcasts to the stereo, too.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628971834.0, "parent_id": "t3_p3xj5l", "replies": [{"author": "little_jonnie", "id": "h8ybnrp", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #248", "submission": "p3xj5l", "stickied": false, "body": "That's pretty cool.", "is_submitter": true, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628973929.0, "parent_id": "t1_h8y72ot", "replies": []}]}, {"author": "BatScribeofDoom", "id": "h8zmo6b", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "", "submission": "p3xj5l", "stickied": false, "body": "Spotify, YouTube, and CDs.
