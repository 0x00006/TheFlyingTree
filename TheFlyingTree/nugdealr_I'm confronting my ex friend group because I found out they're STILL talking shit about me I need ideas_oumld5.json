May I know the cause of this?\". If they give a response and are willing to listen, then you can provide your side. However, if you plan to do this be prepared to keep your emotions calm and staying focused on letting them know the lies are not true.\n* Focus on the goals you have and work towards achieving them. I've been working on another degree and other hobbies. It still hurts to not be able to do my previous activities but focusing on other goals has somewhat helped. In fact, during all this time those people have not had any growth but I've gained skills and other work experiences. \n\nI sincerely hope things get better for you.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1627686024.0, "parent_id": "t3_oumld5", "replies": [{"author": "nugdealr", "id": "h75swkl", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #126", "submission": "oumld5", "stickied": false, "body": "thank you so much I hadn't really thought about the receipts part \nso I'll definitely keep that in mind if I ever do confront them\n\nand again, thank you for your concern", "is_submitter": true, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1627699586.0, "parent_id": "t1_h7536t0", "replies": []}]}, {"author": "L4sgc", "id": "h75me9j", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #75 | Legio Virtus", "submission": "oumld5", "stickied": false, "body": "Obviously there is a lot of information that's missing from this post, but my initial impression is that no good could possibly come from confronting the ex friend group. They would already know you don't want them to be talking shit about you, so it doesn't seem likely that there would be anything you could say that would get them to stop. Definitely don't get into any sort of physical confrontation!\n\nI think you should start by taking some time and really think about your interactions with the other friends. The fact that none of them came to you when the ex friend group started to badmouth you is a huge red flag. If someone came to me and said something about one of my friends I'd tell them immediately and listen to their side of the story.\n\nImo a basic component of human decency is communicating when there is an issue instead of playing games / being passive aggressive / cold as hell with no explanation, and the other friends failed to show that to you.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1627696038.0, "parent_id": "t3_oumld5", "replies": [{"author": "nugdealr", "id": "h75sprf", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #126", "submission": "oumld5", "stickied": false, "body": "holy crap I never thought about it that way thank you omg\nnever realised highschool friend groups ALWAYS Carry the highschool drama everywhere", "is_submitter": true, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1627699477.0, "parent_id": "t1_h75me9j", "replies": [{"author": "L4sgc", "id": "h7664rm", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #75 | Legio Virtus", "submission": "oumld5", "stickied": false, "body": "Glad I was able help a little.
