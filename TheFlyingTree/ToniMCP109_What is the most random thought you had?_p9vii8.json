Live your life travel back in time, change nothing.\n\n2. Eventually past catches up to present and you are born and live your life and travel back in time, changing nothing.\n\n3.  Repeat infinitely.\n\nIf you change something then you may never be born, you may never time travel, you may travel back in time and change something different.  In that case you have a couple of options depending on various multiverse considerations.  In some forms of multiverse, you create a branching universe timeline.  Otherwise it's likely that you would essentially annihilate the future universe you are from and create a new timeline from the moment you arrive in the past.
