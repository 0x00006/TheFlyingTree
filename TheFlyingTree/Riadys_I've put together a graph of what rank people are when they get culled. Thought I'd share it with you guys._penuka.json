{"title": "I've put together a graph of what rank people are when they get culled. Thought I'd share it with you guys.", "name": "t3_penuka", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/penuka/ive_put_together_a_graph_of_what_rank_people_are/", "selftext": "I've split the ranks up into equal-sized groups of 20 for fair comparison. Using data from the past 7 cullings (which was when the current system with 300 seekers was adopted), I've tallied up how many people from each group have been culled.\n\n[Here's the result.](https://imgur.com/a/D1qvjj9)\n\nThe culling before last (23rd August) was suspiciously short, with no acolytes listed past #115 (usually it's at least in the 300s) and there were users who commented on that post saying that they moved up more places than they should have done if the list was complete, which leads me to suspect that it may unfortunately have been incomplete. I've therefore also created [a version of the graph that excludes the data from that culling](https://imgur.com/a/bo4zQwD).\n\nBoth versions of the graph show the same clear trend. *Lots* of recently joined acolytes end up getting culled. Higher ranked users who have been here longer have a much lower culling rate on the other hand. It's interesting how the mass acolyte culling seems to level off at about Acolyte #240, from which point it decreases more slowly but steadily. Also note how druids *aren't* actually the band with the lowest culling rate, with a number of seeker bands being lower.\n\nBecause there isn't a set number of acolytes like there is for druids and seekers, the number of acolytes there are varies from week to week. While I don't have the actual figures for that, looking at the lowest rank to be culled each week can serve as a very rough proxy.\n\n||19 Jul|26 Jul|2 Aug|9 Aug|16 Aug|(23 Aug)|30 Aug|\n|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|\n|Lowest rank culled| Ac. #421|Ac. #404|Ac. #382|Ac. #336|Ac. #319|(Ac. #115)|Ac. #334|\n\nThe lowest rank stats suggest the number of acolytes has decreased by around 100 over the course of the period I used. This explains why the Acolyte #401-420 and #421-440 bands are so low in the graph: for much of the period it's likely there simply weren't any acolytes in the 400s to be culled in the first place.\n\nHope you found this interesting!", "score": 29, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/penuka/ive_put_together_a_graph_of_what_rank_people_are/", "id": "penuka", "author": "Riadys", "link_flair_text": "User Made", "num_comments": 88, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630347601.0, "comments": [{"author": "BasilDream", "id": "haykm4f", "score": 18, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #163 | Classis Veritatus", "submission": "penuka", "stickied": false, "body": "I mean, who doesn't love a good graph?", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630348624.0, "parent_id": "t3_penuka", "replies": [{"author": "The_Lucid_Lion", "id": "hayrkkv", "score": 9, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #291", "submission": "penuka", "stickied": false, "body": "Mmm\u2026 statistical data \ud83e\udd24", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630351496.0, "parent_id": "t1_haykm4f", "replies": [{"author": "Pwngulator", "id": "hb02nj3", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #171", "submission": "penuka", "stickied": false, "body": "Yum yum graph", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630372324.0, "parent_id": "t1_hayrkkv", "replies": []}]}, {"author": "LaLiLuLeLo_0", "id": "hazihls", "score": 4, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #130", "submission": "penuka", "stickied": false, "body": "> who doesn't love a good graph?\n\nSeemingly r/dataisbeautiful.

I can look at this as either going up approximately linearly to 240, then shifting to a logarithmic pattern. Or it could look like exponential up to 320, and then shouldering off. The latter pattern would actually be simpler to explain, and holds up based on a few quick checks of the numbers - people are added at some rank above 350, and advance in their first week of exploratory participation to somewhere between 240-320. So between 240-320 is a mix of one-weekers who happened to start with a higher ranking (and may decide this sub isn't for them) and two-weekers who happened to start with a lower ranking (already habituating as a member).
