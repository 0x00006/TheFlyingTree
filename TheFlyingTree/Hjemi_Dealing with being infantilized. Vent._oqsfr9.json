I'm talking to her about this and I know it comes from a place of caring. But it is still annoying and quite frankly, disheartening. \n\nI was diagnosed a few months ago with ADHD. I now have medication for it and having the right treatment, plus knowing what is wrong with me, has improved the quality of my life a ton.\n\nBut around the time me and some people I'm close to (her included) first even started to suspect I wasn't exactly neurotypical, I noticed a shift in her behavior.\n\nYes, she was always supportive when I struggled with basic things. But suddenly when there was something *wrong*, every little thing became praise worthy. \n\nI did the dishes? *\"Oh my goodness! What a great job honey! I'm so proud of you!\"*\n\nI took out the trash? *\"Wonderful job! You're doing so good!\"*\n\nI paid the bills in time? *\"Wow! Amazingly done darling!!\"*\n\nThe shift from a simple thankyou to THAT felt horrible. I didn't feel like I was doing anything impressive but suddenly she was acting like everything I did was a great feat. I sometimes struggle with longer periods of unemployment but I still have had way more jobs than she has (and I'm currently employed full time). I'm still an adult capable of managing my life. \n\nShe confessed to me yesterday that it's why she doesn't share her issues with me these days. Just like a parent shouldn't burden their children with too many of their troubles, she feels the same. Towards me.\n\n....idk where I'm going with this. It's just horrible right now. I don't regard adhd as a disability.I have never considered myself any sort of disabled even if there have been struggles in my life that others generally didn't seem to have. I manage, and I'm completely cabable. I don't need assistance.\n\nYet, my partner, my fiancee, the person I grew up together with and who's been with me for the past 6 years, is the one person who suddenly doubts my abilities. \n\nShe makes me *feel* disabled.", "score": 18, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/oqsfr9/dealing_with_being_infantilized_vent/", "id": "oqsfr9", "author": "Hjemi", "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "num_comments": 15, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1627141323.0, "comments": [{"author": "N0rthWind", "id": "h6dkk3i", "score": 7, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #74", "submission": "oqsfr9", "stickied": false, "body": "As a fellow non-neurotypical (of a very different kind) I understand the struggle somewhat.

It's literally been my everyday existence ever since I knew myself, it's not like if we ignore it for long enough it'll go away, or if we talk about it it's going to get worse.

I've never had a moment in my life where I had at *least* one friend with it *in every social circle I'm a part of.* And I don't keep very large social circles.  It's common and it's diagnosis is probably either too common, or we should just accept it as part of the human genome at this point.  It's *everywhere.*\n\nIt sounds like your partner is doing some pretty shitty stuff to be honest.  She shouldn't be acting to *anyone* that way, regardless of any neurotypical-ness or not.  It's just rude and offensive.  I may be an outlier on this, but I don't even treat *kids* that way.  I treat them as adults so they can get used to knowing what it feels like to be treated as one, rather than babied and infantilized until they're suddenly 'old enough'.\n\nMy advice is tell all this to your partner.  Tell her you don't want her pity, you don't want her to parent you, and you don't want her bullshit baby talk.  Tell her that a diagnosis isn't a change.  You're exactly the same person you were before.  Tell her she's being a disrespectful cunt.\n\nMaybe don't use words as harshly as I have, there's probably a reason I'm alone and totally disinterested in being in a relationship.  But all the same, you shouldn't have to put up with this and it's totally an awful thing for her to do this to you.

I'm not sure if it's just that it's easier to diagnose or something. There was a whole generation of women with adhd for example where people generally just...didn't get diagnosed because they present differently than men for example. \n\nThis is not based on any proper stats, just my own experience and what I've seen discussed in different adhd groups (which I joined after getting diagnosed), but I believe a common occurance for example is that a child gets diagnosed first,  and a whole lot of the family follow, as adhd, add, and such DO have a hereditary element. I haven't done proper research to see how it works exactly but it's generally passed down.\n\nA common theory I see discussed and joked about is that people with adhd were just really useful in a hunter-gatherer society and it comes from all the way there.... but I also feel like a similar argument could be made for a plethera of things that we just don't really have that much evidence for. \n\nSorry for latching onto that one part in particular, I just find it interesting. Plus adhd does have a spectrum like a lot of disorders. To some people it's completely debilitating even with help and some folks don't require medication etc at all really. As said in the post, I personally feel that \"disability\" is too strong of a word for my experience, but I'm not denying it does affect me daily. \n\n#As for the rest...\n\nI have talked to her about it twice now. Both were longer conversations. I mentioned in another comment one reason for my vent is that while we do communicate, venting does make me feel better as I don't think this will be instantly fixed. She promised to be more mindful of it and I assured her I understand that she means well, but it might still take awhile to get \"back to normal\" so to say. \n\nShe actually didn't even recognize herself that there even was a \"shift\" in her behavior towards me, so that was interesting to hear and discuss. \n\n>I don't even treat kids that way. I treat them as adults so they can get used to knowing what it feels like to be treated as one, rather than babied and infantilized until they're suddenly 'old enough'.\n\nI agree to a point that this is how it should be. Obviously use language that they can understand if we're talking about very young children, and there are some boundaries to take with them, but it should be more common to treat them the same. \n\nA lot of my work is customer service, and in the training we were instructed to not just greet the parents, but to individually acknowledge the children as well if they're around. Basically treat them like they would be an adult friend/companion of the customer because it makes them feel nice.
