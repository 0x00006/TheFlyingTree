For example, you didn't really take a stance on the issue, you merely said it was there and assumed the reader would cone to the same inference regardless of their position. So are you advocating the current socioeconomic issue or do you think it could use work? How, and in what aspect? Are you glad that only some people are getting 'everything' and other 'not enough' or are you advocating for more even distribution? Are you referencing overpopulation?\n\nAnd of course if you are talking about everyone in the world, some will be fickle and laugh, but the single mention of 'black alter powder' is a bit out of line with everything else said- what is that? Is it meant to infer witchcraft is being used to cover blemishes? What has that got to do with the rest of the poem? It's very out of context and it's hard to know if you are being literal (and if you are being literal I have no idea what you are talking about) but maybe I'm missing something but it sounds like you are saying people who wear makeup are the ones who are fickle and laughing, and that's not necessarily true but it;s also irrelevant to the first three lines.
