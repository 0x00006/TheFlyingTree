I like to think about how different people, nations, groups, etc would react to things both realistic and unrealistic, ranging from small scale to universal, from mundane to physics breaking. I do this for both the real world and fictional universes. \n\nFor example: \n\nWhat if a time traveller appeared to Neville Chamberlain before appeasement started  and was successfully able to prove that they\u2019re a time traveller and benevolent. And then began explaining everything that will happen. Europe plunged into darkness, millions of deaths, the fall of the struggle of the RAF against the Luftwaffe. Would that change his mind? Would he attempt to stop the Germans instead of appeasing them?\n\nFor a fictional and less depressing scenario. what if the Imperium of Man from WH40k discovered a fully functional uncorrupted complete STC on Terra containing a perfect archive of all human knowledge? Would it reverse the stagnation? Could there possibly be something to help heal the emperor in there? STCs are basically godly artifacts in the 40k universe. Mars would probably soil themselves.\n\nFor a more silly hypothetical scenario: What if a Multiversal human power suddenly showed up in the fallout universe with far superior technology to anything the factions can muster and just began terraforming the place back to normal. They have like a cure to ghoulism and the FEV and have made it their task to fix humanity\u2019s fuck up on this world. They are powerful enough to absolutely crush any opposition and are very technocratic and utilitarian. Their technology is too advanced to reverse engineer. On one hand they\u2019re making a better world but their methods are questionable. How would the people and factions of that universe react? Who knows. Not me\n\nFor another real world scenario: What if an FTL civilization showed up to Earth and magically deleted climate change and cleaned up radioactive areas like Chernobyl. And then another twist: they\u2019re humans. Genetically engineered to perfection but otherwise normal humans. When asked about why they\u2019re exactly the same despite the massive improbability their only response is \u201cwe\u2019re just as surprised as you are.\u201d This civilization would be from the Triangulum Galaxy and it\u2019s residents are all immortals who have been around for way too long and they\u2019re lost their sense of formality so they show Up to diplomatic meetings with world leaders like \u201cYo what\u2019s up? Why\u2019d we solve climate change? Idk man I just kinda wanted to see what would happen and you know we couldn\u2019t let our fellow human bois suffer like that.\u201d", "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/pd7qsi/does_anyone_else_like_to_think_about_hypothetical/", "id": "pd7qsi", "author": "ATR2400", "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "num_comments": 5, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630148177.0, "comments": [{"author": "obiwanlenobi", "id": "haoy1rg", "score": 3, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #295", "submission": "pd7qsi", "stickied": false, "body": "Yes, although I mostly only do it for real life.
