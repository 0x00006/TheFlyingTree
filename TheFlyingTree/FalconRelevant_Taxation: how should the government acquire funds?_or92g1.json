Why do you think governments not only \"get away\" with it, but their citizens often *demand* it? \n\n> If you have to pay money yearly to have something, that does not mean that you truly \"own\" it.\n\nYou're right. I don't \"truly own\" the land my property is on. At any moment, the government could swoop in and take it from me claiming imminent domain. I'm also subject to a lot of constraints on how I use my property. I can't just dig arbitrary holes, I need to check that there aren't underground utilities first (utilities which are owned or licensed by the government). Depending on where I live, there may even be a town-level agreements like HOAs that could constrain what I can do to my lawn. Zoning ordinances also limit how high my house can or needs to be, and even what I can do on my property. If I want to operate a business from my residence, I would be violating my zoning agreement unless I get some kind of special permit. And I certainly don't control the airspace above my land, and depending on where I live it might not even be legal to hover a quadcopter a foot of the ground on \"my own property,\" because that's not how property works. It's not my own private fiefdom.\n\nNone of what I just described are \"taxes,\" and there's nothing wrong with any of this either. I own my property, but I'm also a member of a community. The community as a group has a right to define certain parameters around what kind of community they want to be, and encourage/discourage certain property uses that are outside of what they want their community to be. These parameters are defined through regulations, ordinances, and laws. As a member of this community, I can influence these and my voice is now part of the decision making process that determines what my community will look like. Enacting and enforcing these regulations costs money, and that's what taxes are for. As a member of this community, I am agreeing to pay taxes in support of the structures that allow the community to exist. \n\nYou might say that this is unfair because you personally don't \"agree\" and are being forced into that contract, but you are also \"forced\" into citizenship. If you want to renounce your citizenship and leave the country, I'm sure there's a process for that and you will no longer be subject to those taxes you so abhor. But people live in communities, and communities evolve governments for some of the reasons I described earlier, so unless you are planning on forming your own country by buying an isolated island or something like that, you're going to be hard pressed to find habitable land that isn't subject to the kinds of governmental structures I described, because they are fundamental to maintaining communities. \n\nEven small communities like co-ops and kibutzes generally have some kind of community rule-making process that everyone is subject to and likely also some sort of sharing economy that permits the accomplishment of large projects that would otherwise be infeasible without the support and involvement of the broader community, like installing and maintaining sanitation or power infrastructure.\n\nYour liberties are limited and certain demands can be made of you. That doesn't mean you don't \"own\" anything. \n\nI challenge you to define \"ownership\" clearly.
