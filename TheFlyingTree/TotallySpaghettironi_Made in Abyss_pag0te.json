I would LOVE to do nothing more than to recommend this show for everyone who enjoys dark fantasy.\n\nI actually still would recommend the anime, as long as this isn't your first rodeo with the world of anime. There is [this great video](https://youtu.be/Z58thY3Lf1E) talking about a giant problem in anime in general(does have MadeInAbyss spoilers though) that is how kids are portrayed a lot.\n\n***However!*** I'd like to add that I agree with the creator of said video that Made in Abyss does go (mostly) into the \"this actually has a narrative purpose and isn't gratuitous\" camp. ***As long as we talk about the anime alone.***\n\nThe manga... oh boy. Yeah, the creator is definitely a pedophile and I cannot defend a whole scene of 12-year old penile torture with barely any narrative purpose and seeing underage breasts at every opportunity this guy gets. It's troublesome, because I really *really* love the world and the story and the characters themselves, and the writing + art is amazing, but I don't want to support that. This is why I read it \"very legally\" online with adblock just in case, I don't want to give this guy any money even by accident.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629815176.0, "parent_id": "t3_pag0te", "replies": [{"author": "StopBanningMeGDIT", "id": "ha7crku", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #254", "submission": "pag0te", "stickied": false, "body": "Oh wow I guess I won't go back for s2.

That's how I still kept up with the manga, though there are a lot of moments that I can't  and ***won't ever*** defend that I think it would be much better off without.\n\nStill, I feel like punishing the entire 100+ anime staff for what one guy (who made the source material) does is unfair but...eh, it's a complicated issue with no black and white answers.\n\nBottomline: Lots of good in this series both manga & anime, but I think it's fair to be prepared so people can make the choice themselves.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629836179.0, "parent_id": "t1_ha7crku", "replies": []}]}]}, {"author": "banana_kiwi", "id": "ha4j59j", "score": 4, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Druid #12 | Consortii Concordus", "submission": "pag0te", "stickied": false, "body": "It may be emotionally taxing or traumatic, but I recommend it if you are looking for media to evoke strong feelings", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629780234.0, "parent_id": "t3_pag0te", "replies": []}, {"author": "QueenOfNights", "id": "ha4o6hs", "score": 3, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #144", "submission": "pag0te", "stickied": false, "body": "Made in Abyss is on eof my favorites.
