Other subreddit topics which the bot may be drawing from or have a strong relationship to included subreddits seem to be science, psychology, atheism, philosophy, and anime(this one is weak since reddit has this bias anyway). I imagine if someone was really dedicated to it they could start compiling data of which subreddits people are members of and use regression analysis to tease out specific ones. \n\nThe weekly culling promotes an active user base by both removing people who aren't active and creating a sense of urgency to being active. This has the effects of encouraging the pointless posts just to maintain activity and the constant additions asking what this subreddit is about. The membership has been around 3.3k to 3.4k while I've been a member but the highest acolyte number I've noticed has only been a little under 500. So there is something there that I don't have an idea on yet. \n\nThe mysterious cult aspects seem just to be for aesthetics. \n\nThe Point, I'm not sure of yet. I think it may be to foster a version of reddit which has low moderation but still remains civil by making people with introverted personalities the majority. Or someone made it just for the hell of it. Or someone's school project. \n\nI'm still observing and looking for patterns.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630563295.0, "parent_id": "t3_pgag7g", "replies": [{"author": "SybariteAussie", "id": "hbabiue", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #177", "submission": "pgag7g", "stickied": false, "body": "Sir you just used your fingers prettier than a painter!
