Of the experiences I've had with cutting people out, ive had two more prominent ones that I dont regret but still dont enjoy how it went down. First one consisted of a very aggressive and arrogant and fragile guy (definition of fragile masculinity) who was a childhood friend, and I had a hard time watching him degrade, degenerate, and give himself and myself a bad name. I wish I had been able to more clearly communicate my feelings but with him, he never would've understood anything other than being a victim. Second one, was a severely socially underdeveloped guy who sorta latched into my in highschool because although he annoyed me, I'm generally not a dick or a bully. To him, that meant I liked him (really sad if you think about it). I took him under my wing for a while but he was to clingy and paranoid after a lifetime of being discarded.

The people that I've removed from my life needed to go. I've been around a lot of abuse, mainly mentally, and rather than a heart of stone, my heart of jello always sticks around way too long. It's lead me down a path of addiction and crime, and my own abuse towards others, and that's not how I was designed. \n\nHow I go about it, though, is rather cold-blooded. Once I've made up my mind to walk away, it's set and I go. I don't say goodbye, I don't hope they notice, I just go about my way never to be heard from again. I hate that about myself, but the alternative brings up way too much emotion that I don't know how to deal with. It's not like I don't look back on the good times, or don't appreciate what we had, but all of that goes in the same box buried deep that all my deceased pets and family members go. A memory bubbles up, I dwell on it until it hurts, and I put it back in the box.\n\nIt's not that I'm unemotional, not by a long shot. The issue is I have too many emotions and whether it's from previous trauma, the undiagnosed ADHD, or just my INTP personality type, I don't know what to do. I'm a logical person, sometimes a bit robotic, and feelings/emotions to me do little to make sense of the world. To me, they just get in the way and I don't know what they always mean, and after years of repetition, I've learned it's easier (not necessarily better, but easier) to just turn them off and deal with the issue at hand until I can't anymore and freak out on my husband for something small like asking why I seem upset.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's protection. It's the same reason I chronically fold my arms across my chest, which most people take as aggression but is really a self-hug. If I didn't just walk away, the people who were holding my mental health captive would have certainly convinced me to stay, and after a decade+ of putting the pieces back together, I just can't risk it and ultimately it was the right thing to do. Also keep in mind, it's hard for most people to walk away, but once they do, they feel better. But folks like myself, it's easy to walk away, but hard to live with. People who are void of emotions would never have been moved enough to make a Reddit post, therefore your display of emotions on Reddit kinda proves the emotions are not, in fact, illusion.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1626737469.0, "parent_id": "t3_onit29", "replies": []}, {"author": "BrynneRaine", "id": "h5tb3x8", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Druid #13", "submission": "onit29", "stickied": false, "body": "I\u2019m not sure I would care or miss the person a whole lot but I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019d feel some guilt.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1626738010.0, "parent_id": "t3_onit29", "replies": []}, {"author": "1i_rd", "id": "h5tfi12", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #199", "submission": "onit29", "stickied": false, "body": "I cut both my parents and a fair bit of my family.
