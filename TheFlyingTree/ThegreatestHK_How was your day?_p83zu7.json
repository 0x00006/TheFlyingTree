I stayed up late last night scrolling reddit, and I wasn't in the best condition today. But I opened up my uncompleted game of Jedi Fallen Order that I left in the dust for a while because I was bored. Took some time getting used to the controls again and fought a gigantic bat. \n\nI had a math lesson scheduled on 6 pm. I did my homework(mostly) and had a quick dinner. \n\nThe air conditioner at the academy was set to extremely low temperatures, and I nearly froze to death. I often forget that summer is ending. Time to stop wearing summer clothing. \n\nI arrived back home and walked my dog. When I got back from the walk, I was invited here.

Mostly scrolling reddit & listening to YouTube. There\u2019s no residual guilt from sharing thoughts with strangers. Am engaging in a social experiment. Trying to understand & comprehend angry people expressing hate & ugly emotions. If I lose my temper & unleash. I will be consumed with guilt as soon as it\u2019s passed. I freeze & resist if I feel anger buildup. Take steps to stymie any outbursts. Use music to manipulate my mood and process anger. I marvel at people that can change gears emotionally from 5th gear back to 1st with no discernible complications. Once 5th gear kicks in for me it comes with either hot adrenaline for pugilistic purposes or a cold brutal mental enhancement that can result in a cold analytic mental dissection of the recipient. Both are equally unpleasant options. Trying to suppress either can result in the shakes, like when you drink too much espresso coffee but more extreme. I think it\u2019s a symptom of adrenaline that instincts release when a fight or flight situation occurs? My thinking is that many people are not truly communicating accurately but using strong language loosely? Many of our strong words are used incorrectly. Some words uttered to convey an idea mean something else. The words wicked, sick& insane now have 2 meanings. Love & hate are used loosely. A square was previously a positive symbol. During combat, a Roman slogan was,hold the square. Phalanx formation & hold shield up etc. Was a important tool for stonemasons.
