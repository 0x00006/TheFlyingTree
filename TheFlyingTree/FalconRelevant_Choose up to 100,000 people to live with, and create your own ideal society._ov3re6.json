Earth will be turned into an asteroid field to ensure the new civilizations have easy access to resources, don't fall back to being primitive planet dwellers again, and to solve overpopulation. \n\nYou have been chosen to be a leader of one of those habitats, how do you choose who gets to go on with you? The aliens have cataloged every human on Earth and can provide you with whatever data you need. \n\nBeware though, the other sovereigns chosen form a very eccentric band, to say the least, you can expect them to create all sorts of societies, all sorts of dystopias and utopias, and even a few hive-minds. All of these fledgling nations will be free to interact with each other, whether to trade, wage war of conquest, or even annihilation.\n\nWhat will you do?\n\nEdit: remember, you will be getting very advanced technology, almost everything can be automated if you choose.", "score": 15, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/ov3re6/choose_up_to_100000_people_to_live_with_and/", "id": "ov3re6", "author": "FalconRelevant", "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "num_comments": 121, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": "moderator", "created_utc": 1627721336.0, "comments": [{"author": "ATR2400", "id": "h78umif", "score": 4, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #60", "submission": "ov3re6", "stickied": false, "body": "As much as I love democracy when we\u2019re dealing with such extreme circumstances it wouldn\u2019t be practical to set up a functional republic right off the get go. I consider myself to be a moderate libertarian but in the most extreme of cases desperate times call for desperate measures. Humanity is on the brink and we can\u2019t afford to waste any time. Despite that some people might get frustrated if they feel as though the government doesn\u2019t care about them so some democratic aspects will be mixed in. \n\nI would go with a constitutional technocratic dictatorship. There would be a strong and empowered head of government as well as an appointed Federal Council I\u2019m not too sure how many people would be on the council but it wouldn\u2019t be anymore than 100 people. \n\nThe members of the council are unelected. They\u2019re selected from the best minds the station has to offer. Not just in scientific fields but also in other useful fields. For example you might have appointed council members who specialize in listening to and communicating with the people in order to meet their needs and keep them from getting uppity. The power of the council and the head of government are limited by a constitution with plentiful enforcement mechanisms. This constitution also guarantees a certain amount of rights and freedoms to the people. The head of government serves a full life term with a new one selected by the council upon their death. They may choose from within their own ranks or they can pick an outsider. \n\nAt the local level is when democracy kicks in. You\u2019ll have a few districts with district assemblies. They\u2019re more efficient than modern Democratic systems and are unicameral. There\u2019s only one house and if a bill passes that house then it\u2019s law. No more divisive and inefficient dual houses. The powers of the districts are less than the USA and is more similar to Russia except ideally without oligarchic corruption. \n\nSociety will have a large focus on education and will of course have totally free education from preschool to college. At least for most courses. There will be expansive universal healthcare and a \u201cright to try\u201d. Traditional welfare systems will replaced with a universal basic income that scales to inflation and cost of living. It will be reviewed every 5 years. Citizens will have pretty decent civil rights and can do what they like so long as it doesn\u2019t threaten the stability of society. They can marry who they want, do what they want(within reason of course. Murder=bad) and to a certain extent say what they want. We really don\u2019t care if you criticize a government policy but please refrain from asking for things like \u201cfull democracy\u201d in an aggressive manner.\n\nThe economy takes a little lesson from history. Full unmitigated capitalism and full unmitigated socialism have both been proven to fail spectacularly. And the mixed market creates this weird symbiotic relationship where corporations and government enhance each other\u2019s power. My new society would be state capitalist. You\u2019d have businesses operating in a capitalistic manner but most of them would be owned and operated by the government. Some with more oversight than others. A local fast food chain? Minimal oversight. Water and power? You better believe we\u2019re watching that like a Hawk. Most of the basic things will be automated. Production and all that. If you\u2019d allow me I\u2019d like to go further and automate the entire supply line. From resource acquisition done by automated mining drones to refinement, to production and finally to shipping them out. For more advanced jobs like programming, law, medicine and research we\u2019ll take an \u201caugment, not replace\u201d approach where we use AI And machines to greatly enhance the capabilities of the workers without outright replacing them. \n\nThe military is a hard one. A lot of society\u2019s resources are already being consumed with inward development. I\u2019ll just have to pick the world\u2019s best military minds and hope that superior strategy and technology can beat superior numbers. Automation of the military while risky seems to be the way to go if we want to have a chance. Especially since space is a cold and dangerous place and the less we expose humans to it the better. We\u2019ll have to trust the aliens figured out how to prevent AIs from going rogue and were so kind as to give us that. \n\n\nThe long term goal of my society would be to expand beyond the station both with in space and on-planet habitats. The colonization of Mars would be a priority. I\u2019d love to colonize the surface of Venus if the alien-provided tech is advanced enough. The acquisition of a stable, cheap-ish and decently high-output source of antimatter would be a secondary goal. Having antimatter would be a source of near-unlimited power, an amazing way to make ships go fast and also could allow us to create a weapon that far surpasses even pure fusion weapons which will make sure no one will mess with us. Even longer-term goals would be the terraforming of Mars and maybe Venus into habitable earth-like worlds. Earth was the shining gem of the solar system and they destroyed it. It\u2019s our duty to replace it. \n\nA secondary even longer term goal would be cracking interstellar travel. If we can get antimatter we can hit relativistic speeds and that makes it easier. If not we\u2019ll have to look to other solutions like laser sails or fusion rockets. Even better if it turns out that negative mass/energy exists and we can make warp drives. I\u2019ve actually heard of positive mass warp drives. They\u2019re STL sadly but it\u2019s better than nothing I guess. Every possibility is worth looking into. Regardless of how it happens beating everyone else to other solar systems is a must.\n\nThere is an alternative dystopian plan but no one wants to hear about how I\u2019d create a spacefaring corporatocracy where life is dominated by a singular megacorporation", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1627767273.0, "parent_id": "t3_ov3re6", "replies": []}, {"author": "ZappyHeart", "id": "h770ey8", "score": 3, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "", "submission": "ov3re6", "stickied": false, "body": "Humans are only one small bit or component of life on earth.
