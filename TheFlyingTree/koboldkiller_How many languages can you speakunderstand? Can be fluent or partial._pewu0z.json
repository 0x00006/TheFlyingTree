That and working from home over the pandemic until I was fully vaccinated has meant I've not had to step up my game until recently.  Working my way through duolingo though, and I have a bunch of textbooks on learning Swedish.\n\nAfter the pain in the ass that was learning French verb conjugations, Swedish seems remarkably simple in that respect.

We've moved to Sweden, and to both Swedish and my way of thinking that means that if I wish to be a part of the culture the least I can do is learn the language.  And I do want to learn the language, I just wish it was easier for me to do.  I am not skilled at language learning, even with French it was a hard slog over six years to get to be fluent and that was with me taking Math, History/Geography, and French all in the French language 5 days a week roughly 10 months of the year for that duration.  What finally tipped me over to fluency was going on an exchange trip to Quebec to a region where they didn't speak a lick of English.  Nothing like necessity to spur learning.\n\nSo for me it's a gradual slog.  Once I get to the point where I can read Swedish, I'll likely pick it up much faster because I read like a fiend.

I am an international Hired Gun for the Oil Patch and have done so for the last 40+ years. \n\nMy native tongue is English, but right after I broke into the oil industry, I worked down South Texas way and learned Oilfield Spanish. It is not your polite, nor conversational, Spanish. *Bordello* is *not* a train station. \n\nThen it was off to Central Asia, where I studied Uzbek. Monstrous language, I could follow most locals and have a haphazard conversation, but writing and reading were a real chore. \n\nThen, off to Russia, for total immersion learning. I picked up Russian rather quickly, and still practice it today. \n\nI liked learning new languages, so I studied Esperanto as my Mother-in-law, a university linguist, spoke it as well. \n\nNext stop was China, so I grudgingly learned Mandarin. What a chore! I thought the Cyrillic alphabet of Russian was rough. Dios Mio! It took me forever to get enough of the language to get a taxi or order a beer. \n\nIn the meantime, I can speak and understand British, New Zealanish, Australian, and Canadian, 'eh? \n\nTook a trip to Mongolia in 2005, so I learned rather a lot of the language before going.

Now I'm a rock doctor, but knowing Latin and Greek helped me in my scientific tenure. \n\nWorking around the world, especially the FSU, once you know the base language, you can start in on various dialects. I can communicate in Chukchi, Evenk, and if really pressed, Lacha. \n\nI lived in the Middle East for decades. Never learned any Arabic other than 'Yes', 'No', and 'I want a cold beer'.
