It\u2019s something I understand intuitively and have a natural interest in, so I\u2019m the kind of person who will look up things like modern trends/shifts in style, spelling, and grammar for fun. For example, I can tell you that while the word \u201ccanceled\u201d was spelled with two Ls in America up through the late 80s or early 90s, the accepted spelling has now shifted to using only one L. Technically both are correct, but one is preferred. I happen to work with a bunch of lawyers, so it\u2019s important to me that I make their writing as appealing as possible when I proofread it. Also, language is such a monolithic subject that it\u2019s difficult to find a single source that comprehensively deals with all aspects of good writing\u2014it\u2019s much easier to find shorter guides to specific aspects of writing. I guess the best place to learn how to write more persuasively would be guides to rhetoric, but again, I can\u2019t recommend any particular text. \n\nI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any \u201cunderrated\u201d older music, as the music that\u2019s been preserved long enough for us to know about it has to have been popular during its own time. In other words, unlike today, where hipsters pride themselves on listening to \u201cstuff you\u2019ve never heard of,\u201d if music back in the day wasn\u2019t popular, then none of us today would ever know about it because nobody would have bothered to learn or record it. Also, popular culture has made certain otherwise obscure music popular again. But to answer your question, I have two recommendations. \n\nThe first is Mongolian or Tuvan throat-singing. It uses a vocal technique that allows the singer to produce two pitches at the same time, and generally also features a string instrument similar to a cello. Try [this song](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HwANedEkqaY) by Enkh Jargal and [another one](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=NuqiOMdoP2c) by Huun Huur Tu. \n\nThe second is something I found more recently. In the 1200s a Spanish king named Alfonso \u201cthe Wise\u201d personally wrote a whole series of songs dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and it turns out medieval music can actually sound really good to modern ears. The most famous one, and therefore the one I\u2019ll recommend, is [\u201cComo poden per sas culpas\u201d](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PPphy89lvao). It tells the story of crippled man who was miraculously healed, but it\u2019s also what kids these days would call \u201ca banger.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re a gamer, try the soundtracks to Civilization 5 and 6. I was very happy that they based a lot of the individual civilizations\u2019 themes on authentic and iconic old music from those cultures, including many songs and styles I already knew about but far more that I didn\u2019t.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630771145.0, "parent_id": "t1_hbje9lt", "replies": [{"author": "QuietFew5805", "id": "hbmawg8", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #592", "submission": "phk2qt", "stickied": false, "body": "OK, Thank you, I've saved your comment for future reference.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630793484.0, "parent_id": "t1_hbkxii9", "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"author": "Kelyaan", "id": "hbk1h4c", "score": 3, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #271 | Consortii Concordus", "submission": "phk2qt", "stickied": false, "body": "Roleplay?
