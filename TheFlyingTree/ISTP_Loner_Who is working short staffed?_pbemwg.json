When you divide out N to get our per-unit price, we get `<constant>/N + <price per unit> + log(N)* <management overhead>`.\n\nAt small scales, this means that the `<constant>` term matters a lot, and bigger companies can provide better prices.  However, at large enough scales, the management overhead term starts mattering.  The bigger you are, the more levels of management you need, and the more those expenses pile up.\n\nThis means that there is a natural optimal size for a given industry.  This can be shifted a bit based on optimizing your overhead costs (so, for example a franchise system has a larger optimal size than a strict top-down), but is still a thing.\n\nThe problem is that in some industries, \"optimal size\" is significantly larger than the entire market size.
