Even today, we continue to see the trend of fewer murders and fewer wars. And so I'd like to ask you what you think has driven the historical trend of decreasing violence, or your general opinions.\n\nI will say historians contribute many factors, ranging from the development of common manners, dispute management systems, rising literacy and education rates, the decrease in dictatorships, and many other things that haven't come to mind.

Marx argued that capitalism\u2014the dynamic of economic growth based on capital accumulation\u2014depends on exploiting the surplus labor of workers, but a post-capitalist society would allow for:\n\n>\"The free development of individualities, and hence not the reduction of necessary labour time so as to posit surplus labour, but rather the general reduction of the necessary labour of society to a minimum, which then corresponds to the artistic, scientific etc. development of the individuals in the time set free, and with the means created, for all of them.\"\n\nMarx's concept of a post-capitalist communist society involves the free distribution of goods made possible by the abundance provided by automation. The fully developed communist economic system is postulated to develop from a preceding socialist system. Marx held the view that socialism\u2014a system based on social ownership of the means of production\u2014would enable progress toward the development of fully developed communism by further advancing productive technology. Under socialism, with its increasing levels of automation, an increasing proportion of goods would be distributed freely.\n\nMarx did not believe in the elimination of most physical labor through technological advancements alone in a capitalist society, because he believed capitalism contained within it certain tendencies which countered increasing automation and prevented it from developing beyond a limited point, so that manual industrial labor could not be eliminated until the overthrow of capitalism. Some commentators on Marx have argued that at the time he wrote the Grundrisse, he thought that the collapse of capitalism due to advancing automation was inevitable despite these counter-tendencies, but that by the time of his major work Capital: Critique of Political Economy he had abandoned this view, and came to believe that capitalism could continually renew itself unless overthrown.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-scarcity\\_economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-scarcity_economy)", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629910561.0, "parent_id": "t3_pah3ej", "replies": []}, {"author": "hydrospanner", "id": "habhw50", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #46", "submission": "pah3ej", "stickied": false, "body": "Communication, transportation, and technology.\n\nMore open, faster communication enables the exchange of ideas, greater possibility for cooperation over confrontation, and a greater chance for breaking down the \"us / them\" way of thinking, making way for the possibility of a \"we\" way of thinking. On a more direct level, communication can help avoid and suppress wars, whether through the channels of diplomacy or threat of war (think an alliance of countries forcing a rogue nation to back down).\n\nSecond, transportation. Not only does transportation facilitate and indeed necessitate communication, but it allows us to move resources from where they're located to where they're needed, and fosters a greater sense of community over a larger area. You're less likely to want to go raid the village downriver when you bring them hides and in exchange they give you fish. Later on in our history, transportation opens up the world to you in ways that were never before possible. When you're able to visit and do business with others, see how they live, and barter for resources to get what you need in exchange for what you have in excess, you are more likely to want to deal peacefully with your neighbors...also, greater transportation means your people are no longer so limited in their advancement by the amount of land they claim. As long as what you produce is in demand, you can translate your strengths into prosperity without having to directly control the land where other resources come from. Of course this doesn't account for scarcity...both natural and intentional...and in this case, transportation advancements can be applied in a military context, to bring your implements of force to your enemy's doorstep...knowing the horrors of battle can no longer be so easily contained to far away fields makes one rethink their appetite for war. \n\nLastly, technology. In many ways, technology directly advances the first two items, but other applications dampen violence in their own ways. Technology can be applied to industry, to allow one man with a machine to produce what ten unaided men might manage. This allows fewer people to produce, process, and deliver more resources, and more resources means more security. When you don't have to worry about where tonight's dinner might come from, you're less willing to risk your own health to steal that dinner. When your nation can produce and process more than it needs, it can export its excess, turning resources into economic power and making trade allies of otherwise aloof neighbors. And of course on the other hand, having an edge in destructive technology makes you less of an speaking target to those same neighbors...and if you're exploiting the less fortunate, advanced technology can overwhelm any of their dissent, and likely even force them into submission without a fight.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629913628.0, "parent_id": "t3_pah3ej", "replies": []}, {"author": "AlternativeMint", "id": "ha4s20j", "score": -3, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #214", "submission": "pah3ej", "stickied": false, "body": "That theory only applies in 1st and 2nd world countries because culture and education.
