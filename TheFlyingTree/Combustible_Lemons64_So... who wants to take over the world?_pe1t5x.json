Obviously, as ruler of the world with near unlimited power, there's now no longer tax shelters. In doing this, it would lower the taxes that working people pay, and account for an overall raise in their take home pay. Instead of corporations paying 6% of the taxes, they'd be paying 49%--representative of the actual profits they earn.   \n\n\nCapital gains would be wholly eliminated as a separate class of taxable income--the rise in value of any real properties or securities that are not your primary residence, would count as income. People earing 140% of the average income in their local area (designated as anywhere within 150 air miles of the largest population center and following where applicable geographic boundries + or - 20 miles), or less would be exempt. This would encourage SMALL businesses and smaller income earners to generate value in their local economies, and not hoard the wealth.   \n\n\nWith life expectancy estimated to be around 80 in a developed nation  (RIP the US--only country moving backwards that's not actively occupied by an enemy), and that your 'working age' doesn't REALLY start until the ages of 26, subtract THAT from 80 to get 54. That's now the new tax on any wealth you own (outside of it simply making an income, WEALTH) over 5 million dollars--comes out to about 1.5%. Yes, that means if you did NOTHING with the wealth you inherit that it would be taxed to under 5 million before you die, and that's fine with me.   \n\n\nInheritance tax would come back with a goddamned FORCE. everything over 5 million is outright forfeit. Gone. Sold and auctioned off. There would be ONE exemption, for the primary residence being inherited--what ever the value of that is, wouldn't count to the 5 million. Enjoy that 25m dollar home you bastards.   \n\n\nExtend universal healthcare to the world. screen, test, and pay for health workers educations. Go into it with the understanding that over half will probably quit, but that's OK. Make sure these people enter their careers WITHOUT debt, so that they can focus on their passions. Leave the hospitals and their employers private where applicable, and the health care system itself government run. IT would create a natural give-and-take, and prevent the government from fucking up SO MUCH SHIT--the VA medical system in the US is shown as a terrible example, but it owns the hospitals AND provides the insurance. No, bad. Leave the capitalist pressure from the employment of healthcare professionals intact, and make it compete against the governments fucking stupidity. Shit'd get better.    \n\n\nUse the majority of the tax money collected, to build a sustainable network of roads, energy infrastructure, and clean water systems world wide. Provide the basis for economic development should someone CHOOSE to move into it. Stop denying places aid because of the color of people's skin, their local lack of education, etc. Build it, and they will come. Stop fucking ignoring Africa, ya dickheads, and get over there and DO SOMETHING.   \n\n\nEnd--in totality--religious tax exemptions of ALL kinds. Churches take up valuable commercial and residential space. Let them stay if they're wanted, and EARN it. Let them be turned into a walmart otherwise. fuck 'em. Exemptions to this would be buildings of historical AND cultural value. If it receives that designation, it doesnt waive the taxes, but when it's repossessed it will now be mothballed and regular  services will be banned on the site.   \n\n\nWithin reason, give a UBI--this should be based on the taxes levied on resource extraction, government leases of lands for exploration, etc. The model for this is the Alaska PFD (minus the fuckery republicans are pulling with it there), and Norway's sovereign wealth fund. Dividends and income would be paid as a percentage of the profit it earns. It would be barred from taking an ownership stake in ANY company, unless that company declared bankruptcy, in which case it takes whole ownership, and gives emplyees an option to buy out the entire thing, OR auctions everything off piecemeal--and the company that lost it doesn't get ANY of their debt obligations forgiven when it happens. Sink or swim bitches, no more bailouts motherfucker! If it made Mitt Romeny rich, let the government compete doing it. Win Win.   \n\n\nAbolish r1-zoning in cities. Fuck you (yes, i own, yes, fuck me too--it needs done god damnit). Stop creating food deserts, and create zoning laws that create and encourage small market, local economies again. Make it HARD for walmart to fucking fit in the space, let alone be wanted.   \n\n\nIncrease building codes and standards to astronomical levels of energy efficiency, and limit maximum housing size based on the local power grid's percentage of green and renewable energy output, so that at 0% the MAX size for a new home is now the HALF national AVERAGE size, and at 100% renewable, is 4xs national average square feet. Exemptions to the size are only allowed if they install devices (solar or wind) to offset the power usage of their home, with 100% offgrid ability allowing 200% the size of the average home (in the US this would mean 4600sf total). This would hopefully be enough of a difference that local builders would pressure local power companies to build renewables into their grid, but allow some wiggle room for home owners who cant control something like that. It would quickly change how people voted, for sure. As the average went up, max size would increase--hey, rich motherfucker, want a bigger house? Get that grid upgraded.   \n\n\nOh, and everyone over 15 can vote nation wide. everyone 12 an over for anything state wide, and any child over 7 attending a public school can vote on ANY funding issue that includes their local schools (bonds, board, regulations, etc). Get represented, lil bros. Watch how fast they stop fuckin with school budgets. Any child that attends school of any age, can vote in anything considered a 'advisory vote.' Kids know more than you think, and dont go with their parents ideas as often as you think either--or else there'd be no need for discipline.    \n\n\nEnd 'right to work' laws. Nuff said there. They get a union in? Join it or starve, fuck off scab.   \n\n\nAlso, there is no longer 'part time' work, as far as using the term for employers to dodge the requirement to provide benefits. Work a SINGLE hour, then it's over. Give them that pension offer biiiiiitch. Exemptions to this are employers with LESS THAN 10 employees. Since there's now universal medical, this shouldnt be an excessive cost for anyone anyway.   \n\n\nunpaid internships, or any other form of labor that's unpaid, is now banned. If you expect work--pay for work. All it does is perpetuate a racist system, and frankly, i'm sick of that shit.   \n\n\nAlso, with unlimited power, make George finish the fucking song of fire and ice.   \n\n\nLast bit is the most important, as any Robert Jordan fan can attest to.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630292236.0, "parent_id": "t3_pe1t5x", "replies": []}, {"author": "SybariteAussie", "id": "hawddje", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #177", "submission": "pe1t5x", "stickied": false, "body": "My main source of discontent is the way media is utilised.
