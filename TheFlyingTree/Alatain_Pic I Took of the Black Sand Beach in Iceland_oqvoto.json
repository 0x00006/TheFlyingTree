One of my favourite things was when we stayed at these cabins and went outside at night with chairs and blankets and just watched the aurora borealis. Another amazing experience was getting to climb S\u00f3lheimaj\u00f6kull glacier (with a glacier climb company). I also climbed a random inactive scoria volcano that our tour guide on the school trip brought us to. Another amazing experience was watching the sunset in the middle of nowhere, I\u2019m pretty sure we were somewhere along the road that continues past Seljalandsfoss. Everything was orange and the view was just breathtaking. Another amazing spot is closer to grindavik, called Valahn\u00fakam\u00f6l. It\u2019s this lookout where you can climb down onto the rocks next to the ocean, they\u2019re so unique and the views are gorgeous.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1627178332.0, "parent_id": "t1_h6f8ns6", "replies": []}]}]}, {"author": "VenomOUShazard", "id": "h6fqxeh", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "", "submission": "oqvoto", "stickied": false, "body": "r/fakealbumcovers would love this", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1627183569.0, "parent_id": "t3_oqvoto", "replies": []}, {"author": "Btankersly66", "id": "h6hadpn", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #169", "submission": "oqvoto", "stickied": false, "body": "I expected to see a crazy eyed Floki running across the sand.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1627225489.0, "parent_id": "t3_oqvoto", "replies": []}]}
