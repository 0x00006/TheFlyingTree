Japan's the best known, but there are others, and the US recently joined the club as well. The US now will no longer gain population unless it allows immigration. That's how low the birth rate is, and there's every indication that it will only get lower.   \n\n\nIf you looked at studies for this, it's alarming. The most impoverished nations on the planet, the worst off, have MORE kids. One, it's to combat child mortality in these places, which is still astoundingly high, but it's ALSO the only real way they have been able to increase the labor pool in order to make enough to survive, or divide tasks over the number of people with the energy capacity to do them (why girls go fetch water--they have fat reserves higher than little boys, and CAN make that trip without falling over from exhaustion, where the boys will work closer, and in short-bursts building, hammering, cutting, etc).   \n\n\nWhen wealth increases, birth rates plummet. Bangladesh, for example. It was a HUGE example of racists and over-population nutjobs back in the 70's and 80's. Each woman there had an average of 7 kids in her life, and NOW--because the economy there developed, wealth increased, childhood mortality plummeted, access to healthcare increased--it's juuuuuuust barely 2 kids per woman, and factoring in how many people die before having kids of their own, they're ALREADY at a natural state of population DECLINE. That's 50 years, sure. India's population growth rate as a total, is about where the US's was in the 70-'s, known in the US as the 'baby bust' (\\*waves to the gen-x'rs, arnt you glad THAT name didnt stick to your generation?).  \n\n\nSo, just to go off on a related tangent, everyone knows china had the One Child policy, right, and the disaster it was. It worked though, it did what they wanted it to do, prematurely halt the birth of SO MANY poor rural children. It's what allowed them to funnel something like 50% of their population, inside of 2 generations, from rural to uban centers. It made such a massive difference, that they've eliminated it and now people are choosing not to have kids, because they see it as an economic choice that makes sense. It's no longer \"kids are a source of farm labor for us' it's 'kids COST money.'  \n\n\nBUT--china ALSO saw what was going on in the rest of the world, Japan, Germany, Italy, and even the US--where economic development would naturally scale back population growth, and they've done a LOT of that inside their own country (and it's partly why they refuse to lower carbon output until 2030--they need time to catch up to countries that already HAVE that level of economy)--but they're spreading this to other, poor, backwards countries with population problems. If you look in China, at some of the poorest countries with the biggest problems with population, China is stepping in and building them roads, infrastructure, and economies. They're MAKING the economic growth, so that 1. they have 'middle class' customers in the future, but TWO--so that THEIR population growth wont have to be curtailed to control world population. They're planting the seed to stop population growth through the economic tools we KNOW work, so that they're better off to not have to worry about theirs down the road.   \n\n\nWe'll likely never see 9 billion people. Heck, we're more likely to see 7 billion again before i die than we are 9.   \n\n\nThe population isnt the stressor, it's the resources they're using. We have to fix THAT. a SINGLE farm in eastern Washington, growing corn, pumps more water out of the ground than half a million people use for their homes every year. It's 100% turned into ethanol for fuel. Not eaten. We dont need to do that, it would be smarter to invest that SAME land area into solar, or wind, and upgrade the grid to accommodate the change.   \n\n\nThe carbon footprint of ALL the people that live in Africa, is so small that if the whole of the world lived like that, there'd be no climate change. So, we have to find a sustainable way to live, and make it seem like we're CHOOSING that, rather than being forced. That's the task ahead of us as a species.

Of course we can.   \n\n\nWILL we? No, probably not.   \n\n\nLets focus on something, for a second--housing codes.   \n\n\nThe average house in the US is 37 years old. Lets, for the sake of making this easier, say it's 40 years.   \n\n\nBefore 1980, there was NO REQUIREMENT for homes to be insulated. The average home built before 1980 may have ZERO, to r-13 for insulation. R3 is more likely.   \n\n\nThe resources to heat these homes is massive. It's far and away the largest draw on the power grids, and in some states in some locations these homes can suck down 1700kwhrs--just MASSIVE power consumption.   \n\n\nThere are houses out there, built PAST the basic codes for insulation, that can be heated on LESS than a hair dryer. Some, are so energy efficient, it can be heated with your body heat alone. We're talking about homes that can be heated with LESS THAN a hair dyer, on low. About as much energy as leaving a 100 watt light on for a month.   \n\n\nWILL WE make those the codes? No. CAN WE? Yes of course we could. Imagine, if, in the span of the next 40 years, we could reduce the energy consumption of housing in the US by 90%? It's possible. not probable.   \n\n\nThe fields we currently use to grow corn, many of them are used to grow corn that's turned into Ethanol. Growing these crops, JUST THE ETHANOL crops, makes the US use 47 TRILLION gallons of water a year. (to put this in perspective, that's 2.5 times more water than humans use at home, and for ALL residential uses--300 gallon average per day). For JUST CORN, that we throw in our gas tanks. (Another way to see the corn--the Colorado river would have to run, for over two solid years, to add up to the amount of water we use for JUST corn to put in our gas tanks)  \n\n\nImagine if that same number of acreage, OR water, was used to generate electrical power--and how clean we could make a grid. We could power the entire US--and create water-storage, dam-like batteries for the over-production, on JUST the corn acres and water usage.   \n\n\nWe wont, but, COULD we? Yes.   \n\n\nSo, idk, we KNOW these things, we SEE these things, its possible to do these things--but it's not profitable.   \n\n\nSo, CAN we? Sure. We can live in a sustainable world.
