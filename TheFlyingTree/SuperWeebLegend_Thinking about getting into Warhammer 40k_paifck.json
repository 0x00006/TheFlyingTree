If you want to win games, you'll need to spend money. There's no balance: if your opponent can afford a giant mecha tank, and you can only afford a few infantry, that's that. Even in comparison to other mini-based wargames from the same era, it requires a _lot_ more units on the board than something like Battletech, inflating the cost of play.\n\nIn modern times, with 3d printers, there are (technically illegal) options for spending _less_ money. But if you want to play at one of the Games Workshop brick-and-mortar stores, you'll be required to use only official minis. At independent stores, people are a lot more chill about printed minis so long as they're painted and everything. So if you're trying to get into it, especially on a budget, you should definitely check where you can actually play near you.\n\nAlso, and I hope people here don't take too much offense... but I have found Warhammer people to be some of the least friendly folks in game shops. Not that they'll be outright dicks to a new player, mind you. But most of them are playing to _win_, and I've heard a lot of very loud and personal arguments erupt in game shops from the Warhammer table. I've never actually seen a fistfight, but I've definitely heard somebody scream \"let's take this outside.\" There's also, sadly, a minority of Warhammer players who have based their personal philosophy or politics around the in-game lore and thus have become literal fascists.\n\nPersonally, I find Warhammer itself pretty appealing. The minis and lore are pretty cool. The game has a tendency toward tedium, but it can be fun with the right scenario.
