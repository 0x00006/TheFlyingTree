Drain Gang: Bladee, Ecoo2k, Thaiboy Digital, and Yung Sherman).\n\nBoth are loose collectives of rappers/producers who mainly grew up in Sweden together and started making rap in their teens. They pioneered a style called mumble rapping/cloud rapping on SoundCloud/YouTube and basically blew up overnight (American mumble rap went into an entirely different direction and you\u2019ll likely see a lot of people criticizing it for being lazy).\n\nAll of the music they make has a very ethereal, dreamy quality with production that\u2019s usually a couple years ahead of the curve in terms of trends. A lot of their vocals are strangely haunting, English is usually their third language so they have these janky bars with sometimes no flow or are atonal but they stick in your brain. Their more aggressive songs feel like the last vestiges of a bad dream as you claw your way to wakefulness, it\u2019s intense in the strangest way possible. They use a decent amount of auto-tune, but each rapper has their own distinct brand of noise going on so it\u2019s not always the case.\n\nIf you\u2019ve even bothered to read this far, I\u2019d highly recommend [Victim](https://youtu.be/HDajKZ3ytdY). The context for this song is that legendary drain gang member Thaiboy Digital was deported from Sweden in 2015 over visa disputes and the sadboys and the drain released songs expressing their grief over their childhood friend being deported. In 2019, the drain gang travelled to Bangkok to make a mixtape with Thaiboy called \n\u201cTrash Island.\u201d This song/video (and many others on Trash Island) have a very \u201ceuphoric reunion with melancholic undertones\u201d vibes.
