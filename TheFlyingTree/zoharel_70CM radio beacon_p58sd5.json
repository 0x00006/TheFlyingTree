It's a fox hunt beacon that will do either CW or MCW on the 440Mhz amateur radio band.  It's based on an ESP32 and an SX1278 LoRa transceiver, which is quite cheap and can also be used as a generic FSK modem.  I used a Heltec WIFI LoRa 32 board, which includes the transceiver, but of course there are quite a few possible ways to do this.\n\nFirmware, schematics, and a bit of a technical write-up are available on GitHub.  https://github.com/kemenril/LoRaFox", "is_submitter": true, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629087495.0, "parent_id": "t3_p58sd5", "replies": []}, {"author": "NoSuchKotH", "id": "h95qp6v", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #91", "submission": "p58sd5", "stickied": false, "body": "Science Unit nitpick:\n\n* Units that are derived from names are capitalized, those that aren't derived from names are all lower case\n* Prefixes have specific capitalization and these are important. d and D are different prefixes, as are m and M.\n* The abbreviation for liters is the only one that can be written as lower case l or upper case L, because some people write 1 in a weird way and confused it with l. Those who write 1 normally are supposed to use the lower case l for liters, though.\n* kg is the only unit unit, where the base unit has a prefix already. Prefixes for kg replace the k. They do not prefix the prefix. I.e. it's \u00b5g not nkg.\n* Compound units are supposed to have a multiplying dot \u00b7 between units. But many people leave the dot out or replace it by a half space, especially in handwritten notes, if the unit is unambiguous.\n\nExamples: \n\n* cm ( meter, not a name, with centi prefix)\n* MHz ( Hertz, from Heinrich Hertz, mega prefix)\n* kg\u00b7m/s^(2) (Newton expressed in base units, with multiplication dot \u00b7)", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629123341.0, "parent_id": "t3_p58sd5", "replies": [{"author": "zoharel", "id": "h96k7wk", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #82", "submission": "p58sd5", "stickied": false, "body": "You're right.", "is_submitter": true, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629135050.0, "parent_id": "t1_h95qp6v", "replies": []}]}, {"author": "Walking_the_Cascades", "id": "h965e41", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #68", "submission": "p58sd5", "stickied": false, "body": "Had to look up \"fox hunt beacon\".
