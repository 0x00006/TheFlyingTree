This seemingly simple sounding observation led Einstein to come up with special and general relativity.\n\nA====> <==B <====C\n\nImagine you're at point B driving 20 km/hr towards A. A is driving toward you at 40 km/hr and C is driving toward you at 40 km/hr.\n\nFrom your perspective, the relative speed of A coming toward you is 60 km/hr. And, the relative speed with which C is overtaking you is 20 km/hr.\n\nNow, imagine the same scenario at much higher speeds. You're still B. But, now you're in your VeryFast^(tm) space ship going toward light source A at 50% of the speed of light. Light from A is coming toward you at the speed of light. Light source C is emitting light that is overtaking you going the speed of light.\n\nFrom your perspective, it would make sense if light from A were coming towards you at a relative speed of 1.5 times the speed of light. And, it would make sense that light coming from C would be overtaking you at a relative speed of 0.5 times the speed of light.\n\nIn reality, you see the light coming towards you from both A and C moving at a relative speed of the speed of light.\n\nThis simple observation, that light coming toward the earth from all directions, regardless of the earth's motion, appears to be the same speed was enough to lead Einstein to deduce much of relativity. \n\nIt led to the hypothesis, later confirmed and used in your GPS system, that time is not constant for all observers. Time physically ticks at different rates on satellites in geosynchronous orbit than on the surface of the earth. And, it matters when calculating our positions with such systems.\n\nHere's an explanation of how this can be intuited from the consistency of the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation#Simple_inference", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629710101.0, "parent_id": "t3_p9vwhq", "replies": [{"author": "Muroid", "id": "ha12kyw", "score": 3, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #128", "submission": "p9vwhq", "stickied": false, "body": "The constant speed of light is largely derived from Maxwell\u2019s equations describing electromagnetism, rather than observations about the speed light travels in different directions, though the Michelson-Morley experiment did knock a major hole in the Luminiferous Aether theory that, up to that point, was the major solution for what light was traveling at a constant speed relative to.\n\nRelativity\u2019s major breakthrough was resolving this existing conundrum by answering the question with \u201crelative to everyone\u201d and then mathematically working out what the consequences of that would be.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629724961.0, "parent_id": "t1_ha0gmcm", "replies": [{"author": "MisanthropicScott", "id": "ha1bwaj", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Druid #6 | Ordo Cognitus", "submission": "p9vwhq", "stickied": false, "body": ">> The speed of light in a vacuum is constant for all observers.\n\n> The constant speed of light is largely derived from Maxwell\u2019s equations describing electromagnetism\n\nDid Maxwell know that it would be constant *for all observers*? That is kind of a big deal. I thought it was that discovery that was the underlying raw data that caused Einstein to come up with relativity.\n\nIt wasn't that relativity dictated that the speed of light must be constant relative to all observers. I think that was the observation prior to relativity that led to relativity. That was the brute fact, the raw observation, that relativity explains.\n\nAs you note, this fact was discovered by the [Michelson-Morley experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment), which took place in 1887, well before Einstein developed either special or general relativity.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629729300.0, "parent_id": "t1_ha12kyw", "replies": [{"author": "Muroid", "id": "ha1gvz3", "score": 3, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #128", "submission": "p9vwhq", "stickied": false, "body": "The constant *c* falls out of Maxwell\u2019s equations.

Just as the straight lines of longitude, that begin parallel at the equator, converge at the north pole due to the Earth's shape, the orbit of a planet around the Sun is actually a straight path, the straightest possible path that it could follow in spacetime with that initial velocity.\n\nWe're all traveling at the speed of light. The catch is, we travel almost exclusively through time. Motion through space is just a way to divert some of that motion to movement through space. The fastest speeds we can travel are just a couple thousand miles per hour, which is nothing compared to light speed, so we almost never travel much through space. \n\nSo, most of the gravity we experience is due to the curvature of time specifically.\n\nIn math, curvature causes distances and durations to change from place to place.
