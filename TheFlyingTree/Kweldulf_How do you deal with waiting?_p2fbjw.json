I came as fast as I could, vet gave him medicine and the dog was fine, but the vet reccommended an MRI. In order for a dog to not move in an MRI they need to be put under narcosis - which is dangerous especially for a 14 year old dog. This morning I signed a consent for them to perform the exam. It's been a few hours and every minute makes it worse, so here is the question - How do you deal with waiting for news in such situations? Any tips, experiances?\n\nEDIT: Doggo survived anestesia. We are on the way home, he is still a bit meh after the whole thing, hurting and pooping but feeling better by the minute. We had to go some 200km for the MRI, so its a massive adventure, but almost over.

It doesn't get easier, but you will get better.\n\nMy only advice for coping is to embrace it rather than avoid it.
