You might also have heard of Helluva Boss, set in the same universe, about quirky demons running a hit man service).\n\nSo far I\u2019ve got things like Archetypes (like D&D\u2019s races), Careers (like Classes), some Elite Advances (extra things to take at the start of character creation), I shamelessly stole the talent list from the fan made Genesys Talents Expanded list (basically the community pooling all talents from all sorts of sourcebooks into one list), and have begun laying out most of the weapons. I\u2019ve also commissioned art to be included in various parts of the book (and once the guts of the hack is in place I will write flavor text in full).\n\nMy question is what do you think I might have overlooked of have forgotten to mention? \n\nI intend to share this with people in order to play test/identify sections for errata (perhaps to this sub since you are all fellow initiated ones), but that will come once it\u2019s in a semi-stable condition.", "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/p4jyi3/what_do_you_feel_is_necessary_when_making_a/", "id": "p4jyi3", "author": "WikiContributor83", "link_flair_text": "Question", "num_comments": 5, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628989319.0, "comments": [{"author": "agaminon22", "id": "h8z9zp7", "score": 4, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #174", "submission": "p4jyi3", "stickied": false, "body": "Items that are not weaponry I find are some of the coolest parts in tabletop RPGs.

Magic point systems that allow you (or even the players) to create costier spells with more powerful effects have a special place in my heart and is the first thing I would look into when designing a hack \n\nDon't know how relevant this is to the thread, because it's not necessary.
