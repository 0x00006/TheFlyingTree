I can advise that it's a sound practice to use the highest-resolution sources you can and keep your project files until after you've finished presenting (and for as long after as you have the hard drive space, if possible) because you'll never know when you might want to revisit a project or present it in a fresh way. When I started college, 1280x1024 CRT monitors were still the norm and 300 DPI was considered acceptable for printed work, but I can't display any of my old renderings on a modern 4K panel and expect anyone to know what's going on. I kick myself for not keeping my old 3dsMAX files from that period because I know that a few of them would still look phenomenal today.\n\nThat aside, I see an Ultramarine. More of a Black Templars man at the moment, myself, but I give due respect.
