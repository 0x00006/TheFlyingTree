Matter to who? In what context?  Why must something have longevity in order to have worth? While I agree that we shouldn\u2019t fret or stress over things we have zero control or influence over, everything matters to the one it matters to, regardless of when it will happen.  I\u2019m of the opinion that things like worth, value, purpose, and meaning are purely subjective, lacking any inherent objective anchorage in reality (Existential Nihilist here).  So dismissing the value of something lacking everlasting or world shaking effects and impact only serves to put undue stress and unrealistic expectations on the individual, essentially implying that unless you make a difference you\u2019re shit.  It leads to an unfulfilled life filled with regret IMO.  Just do what you want (accepting the consequences of the actions of course), life is short enough as it is, and suppressing yourself does nothing but damage and wastes what little time we have.

But, there are things that matter in the short term that can be incredibly important. Imagine the case of when to take a patient off life support or when or whether to euthanize a beloved pet.\n\nIn either case, in five years the patient will be dead. But, it matters a lot to the patient and probably to your own psyche going forward.\n\nI'll throw the question back to you.\n\nWhat would you think of your quote in such cases?
