This is the first year it worked. We opted for a slightly larger planting area, but doing it in a three sisters planting method. Basically planting mounds in an area with corn, then after the corn takes, pole beans, then shortly after a squash or pumpkin. The corn gives the beans a climbing surface, the beans give the corn a bit of support, and the squash provides a low-laying ground cover to suppress weeds.\n\nWe did 10 mounds and it has worked out pretty well. You just need enough corn to pollinate everything. This planting resulted in a lot of corn, but not all of it was fully formed. We might go a bit larger next year and see what we get.", "is_submitter": true, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628383861.0, "parent_id": "t1_h844n2z", "replies": [{"author": "journeyofthemudman", "id": "h84gqx0", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "", "submission": "ozt70x", "stickied": false, "body": "I did a similar three sisters except I did lemon cucumbers instead of squash or pumpkin. \nI planted 4 rows of 6 corn stalks so on theory that should've been sufficient. Instead I ended up with stunted or half developed cobs. They were still really sweet and delicious but I'm not sure what went wrong.
