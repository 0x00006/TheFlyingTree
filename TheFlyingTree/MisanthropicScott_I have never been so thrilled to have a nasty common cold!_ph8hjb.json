I rushed to take the rapid COVID test because we happen to have a lot of plans (which are now cancelled or postponed anyway) in the upcoming week.\n\nPlease be aware that the antigen test (rapid test) is nowhere near as accurate as the RT-PCR test.\n\nOf course, it came back positive. So, my wife and I both rushed out to get the PCR test, which takes 12-18 hours.\n\nWoo hoo! The PCR came back negative. I have never been so thrilled to have a cold.\n\nOur current working hypothesis is that since some versions of the common cold are also corona viruses, that the cold may have triggered the false positive on the antigen test. I can't be sure really, of course.\n\nBut, I'm so thrilled that it's not COVID that I'm *happily feeling like crap* and avoiding going outside my front door. I figure even though it's not COVID, no one wants to see even a masked person out walking around sneezing, coughing, and all the rest. It's just not nice to scare the crap out of people like that.\n\nI will say that I was mildly disappointed that at the testing facility, about 30% or so of the people were waiting outside without their masks on. And, not all were properly social distancing. \n\nI almost wanted to scream, \"People! You do realize we're all here because we all suspect that we may have COVID, right?\" But, while I am an asshole, I'm not that particular type of asshole. I just kept my own N-95 on and kept my distance as best I could, shifting away from people, especially the maskless, as well as I could.", "score": 14, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/ph8hjb/i_have_never_been_so_thrilled_to_have_a_nasty/", "id": "ph8hjb", "author": "MisanthropicScott", "link_flair_text": "Other", "num_comments": 28, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630686125.0, "comments": [{"author": "baalroo", "id": "hbgxlbs", "score": 3, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #120 | Legio Virtus", "submission": "ph8hjb", "stickied": false, "body": "Yo, almost the same story here.
