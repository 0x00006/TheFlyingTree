They seriously muddled Joe Gardner\u2019s desire to be a pianist. Literally the entire movie was spent with him being an avid musician, wanting to play with the greats, and being an incredible artist himself. Then he gets to live his dream out for ONE NIGHT\u2026suddenly he\u2019s like \u201cwell, if that\u2019s all there is to it then I guess I\u2019m good to die now\u201d\n\nReally!? I don\u2019t like that they had to shoehorn a reason for him to be ok with death but still man, to me it made all of his previous arguments about being this intense lover of music so\u2026.superficial. The look on his face when Dorothy says \u201cnow you go home, come back and do I again tomorrow\u201d should not be disappointment, I\u2019d want to believe it should be pure joy. Like \u201cHell yea! I did why I love tonight, and I get to do it more tomorrow!? And get paid for it!?\u201d \n\nIt kinda reminds me of the movie \u201cWhiplash\u201d where you see all the struggles and trials and tribulations of being in a top tier band, but there was no joy in actually making the music. Like, did we forget the reason we love it is because it\u2019s fun and that\u2019s why we want it to be our lifelong career?", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630694270.0, "parent_id": "t3_pgynh4", "replies": []}, {"author": "catssej", "id": "hbieyy0", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #88", "submission": "pgynh4", "stickied": false, "body": "My favourite part of the movie was the point of enjoying the little things around us.
