Enjoying things created by others (eg a white person in Canada going for sushi) is helping preserve other cultures. Different cultures add variety and flavour to places, I wouldn't want to be in a city with no Chinatown or other ethnic districts and you can really expend your horizons that way. I definitely want to celebrate other cultures and ethnicities and respect them.\n\nI love visiting cultural districts and celebrating their ethnicities.\n\nQuestion: if you try and prevent historical ethnicities, cultures, whose are we deciding on? Who was there first? In the US will everyone have to start being in the cultures of the Native Americans? Would I suddenly switch to the Kuringai Aboriginal Nation? I mean I;d be ok with that if they'd have me but I'm disabled so I'd be more if a basket weaver than a wallaby hunter anyway.\n\nI mean obviously it would have to stay but then what are the rules? Who is in and who is out? Can we still have sushi? Won Ton Soup? Pizza? Will the lovely Morroccan restauarnt down the street be closed? The cool place that sells Egyptian stuff? What about museums?\n\nAlso to freeze culture is to freeze time. No more anime, no more K-pop, in Australia we'd have to get rid of rap and hip hop.... and now more new music, art or technology from \"other cultures\". That would have a sad world and the policing would be stifling.\n\nIt sounds like going back to the '50's.\n\nThere are two caveats here:1: restricting the freedom of others to the point where it gets dangerous- in Canada I almost has a collision with a women backing her huge Bronco truck out, she couldn't see my small Toyota because she was in full burkah and didn't have good (or maybe any (I don't know how translucent the fabric is at the sides)) peripheral vision. Conversely if someone wants to and it's not in danger I support them wearing it if they want and if I was in France I might even wear a hijab to support people who want to wear those (how do they even support that anyway, can you just tell the hijab cops it's not a hijab it's a babushka?) And a \"burkini\" (which looks like excellent jellyfish protection if you ask me, I might get one).\n\n2: Surgically modifying people who cannot consent. Male and female circumcision is out except for medical reasons, and then it's done in a hospital by doctors with anesthetic.
