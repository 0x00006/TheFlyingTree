While the show is about Hannibal, he is only a part of it.  The main Character is Will Graham who is an empath and the FBI uses him (often against his best wishes) to help find other serial killers.  Hannibal is actually recruited by the lead FBI guy as a psychologist to assist in solving the crimes.  The story and cinematography is amazing, and while there is a lot of scenes with Mads preparing meals (quite extravagantly) they are mostly all normal animals, although it is very suggestive and leaves you wondering...is it?  It is a very graphic show but more so in the depictions of the aftermath of other killers and the cannibalism isn't as overt as cutting and devouring people.  Not to give too much away but he isn't targeted by the FBI till at least season 3 I think, not really a spoiler if you've seen the movies lol.  It is a great psychological thriller and I would say give the first episode a shot and go from there... but like I said, it is graphic (it opens with a human corpse totem pole by another killer soooooo...).", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629989577.0, "parent_id": "t1_hafdl5y", "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"author": "SchoggiToeff", "id": "hafp9cp", "score": 3, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #114", "submission": "pbw3ac", "stickied": false, "body": "Manhunt:Unabomber - which is about the capture of the Unabomber.
