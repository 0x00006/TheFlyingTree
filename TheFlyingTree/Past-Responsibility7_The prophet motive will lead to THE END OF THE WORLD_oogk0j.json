This is an enormous leverage point available to the grass roots that most people know nothing about.\n\nI'll just c&p from comment I made elsewhere:\n\nFar, far more effective is to **boycott financial products** like **credit cards** and **bank accounts** offered by harmful corporations that **invest in fossil fuels**.\n\nThis is the huge leverage point at which to put pressure.  All new fossil fuel ventures require financing, i.e. loans from banks.  The biggest investments in new mines isn't, amazingly, by the companies that do that mining, but by the banks that lend them the money to do so.\n\nConvincing these banks not to invest in fossil fuel ventures \u2013 **divestment** \u2013 is a tremendous leverage point because the fossil fuel industry can't do without the banks, but the banks, for all the money they make from fossil fuels, actually can do without the fossil fuel industry, because they actually make so much more money in other sectors.\n\nFor more information, check out this article in the NewYorker, from 2019 by climate activist Bill McKibben: \"[Money Is the Oxygen on Which the Fire of Global Warming Burns](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/money-is-the-oxygen-on-which-the-fire-of-global-warming-burns)\".  Teaser (all emphasis mine):\n\n>But what if there were an additional lever to pull, one that could work  both quickly and globally? One possibility relies on the idea that  political leaders are not the only powerful actors on the planet\u2014that  those who hold most of the money also have enormous power, and that  their power could be exercised in a matter of months or even hours, not  years or decades. \\[...\\]  \n>  \n>Consider a bank like, say, **JPMorgan Chase**, which is America\u2019s largest  bank and the world\u2019s most valuable by market capitalization. In the  three years since the end of the Paris climate talks, Chase has  reportedly committed a hundred and ninety-six billion dollars in  financing for the fossil-fuel industry, much of it to fund extreme new  ventures: ultra-deep-sea drilling, Arctic oil extraction, and so on. In  each of those years, ExxonMobil, by contrast, spent less than three  billion dollars on exploration, research, and development. A hundred and  ninety-six billion dollars is larger than the *market value* of  BP \\[British Petroleum\\]; it dwarfs that of the coal companies or the frackers. By this  measure, Jamie Dimon, the C.E.O. of JPMorgan Chase, is an oil, coal, and  gas baron almost without peer.  \n>  \n>But here\u2019s the thing: fossil-fuel  financing accounts for only about seven per cent of Chase\u2019s lending and  underwriting. The bank lends to everyone else, too\u2014to people who build  bowling alleys and beach houses and breweries. And, if the world were to  switch decisively to solar and wind power, Chase would lend to  renewable-energy companies, too. Indeed, it already does, though on a  much smaller scale.  \n>  \n>\\[...\\]  \n>  \n>Every year, after six months of detailed analysis, \\[the Rainforest Action Network\\] publishes a  thick report called \u201cBanking on Climate Change,\u201d which ranks the  financial giants according to how much damage they\u2019re doing.  \n>  \n>This  year\u2019s edition, the tenth, shows Chase in the lead, as usual, followed  by **Wells Fargo**, **Citi**, and **Bank of America**. Two Japanese banks and the  British giant **Barclays** are also among the top ten, but it\u2019s mostly a  North American club\u2014three Canadian banks round out the list. And the  trend is remarkable: in the three years since the signing of the Paris  climate accord, which was designed to help the world shift away from  fossil fuels, the banks\u2019 lending to the industry has increased every  year, and much of the money goes toward the most extreme forms of energy  development.\n\nIf you're in the US, one way to get your money out of fossil fuel investing banks is to pick local banks and credit unions for your banking needs.  Your local credit union is probably not funding fracking, you know? Many small financial institutions get their credit card services through Elan Financial Services, which is owned by US Bankcorp, which was [the first financial institution in the US to commit to no longer financing fossil fuels](https://impactalpha.com/u-s-bancorp-halts-fossil-fuel-project-lending-c84d3555d31c/).", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1626850107.0, "parent_id": "t3_oogk0j", "replies": []}, {"author": "meoemeowmeowmeow", "id": "h5yreh0", "score": 5, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "", "submission": "oogk0j", "stickied": false, "body": "Guillotine all billionaires.

You work every single day, without fail, without ever getting sick, without getting taxed, no major expenses, no major losses or accidents.  Every single day you work, and get $5k a day.  Sounds like a pretty amazing deal, right?  Well, lets further this thought, and ask \"how long would it take to earn a billion dollars?\"  Lets pick an arbitrary date.  The day Columbus lands in America, for instance.  \n\nIf you worked for $5,000 a day since Columbus landed in America proper to today, assuming you somehow found the fountain of youth too, you would only have roughly $965,425,000 in today's currency, also ignoring inflation.  You can not work and \"earn\" a billion dollars.  \n\nIt is impossible.\n\nTake Jeff Bezos for a second.  Dude is worth $203.7 billion dollars.  I don't give a damn about the distinction between stocks, and assets and liquid.  Using the above example of earning a great deal of money per day, lets go back to another arbitrary date, the time of the first of the Great Pyramids of Giza's construction, ~2780 BCE, give or take a few years just for the sake of argument.  Lets also up the amount of money to $25,000 a day.  Preserve the other qualifications for the thought experiment too; you won't get sick, you'll be functionally immortal, zero major costs, zero taxes, zero loss of money whatsoever of any kind.  Lets presume again, you work every single goddamn day.  Every day, $25,000, sounds like a lot.  It is a lot, its a fuckton of money.  \n\nYou'd still have less than 1/5th of Bezos' money.  \n\nYou **cannot** earn a billion dollars.  There's only two ways to get it; inheritance, or wage theft.  You cannot work so hard or produce so much value, all by yourself, just by making agreements or selling a product, or making a business, you cannot do so much work that the end result is you actually working to get a billion dollars.  Jeff Bezos made [*thirteen billion dollars in* **ONE DAY**](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/21/bezos-record-multibillion-dollar-net-worth-gain-bloomberg.html) in the middle of the pandemic, when thirteen million people lost their jobs and five and a half million lost their homes.  This is absolutely impossible through any work.\n\nMeanwhile, the average Amazon employee is making a massively fantastic living of...oh. [$29,007 per year.](https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-employee-salary-pay-median-worker-compensation-compared-jeff-bezos-2021-4)  What this is describing is **wage theft.**  Bezos is robbing his workers blind to pay himself so much money that he cannot possibly go broke, ever.  His ex-wife, last year, [gave a over five and a half billion dollars in charity.](https://www.denverpost.com/2021/06/15/mackenzie-scott-donations/)  She [already earned it back after donating even more.](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/21348052/mackenzie-bezos-scott-donating-billions-ex-jeff-bezos-amazon)\n\nBillionaires are not just bad, they are the evil, and anyone that justifies this amount of money is likewise an agent of evil.  \n\nWhile I do not agree with any non self-defense based use of violence, I sure fucking understand how people are beyond pissed, and yes, making references to the French Revolution where the aristocrats were guillotined.  I'm not advocating for anything, nor I suspect is /u/meoemeowmeowmeow or /u/snuffybox, but I sure fucking understand why people are pissed beyond belief at the fact that they can't pay for rent, food, and their hobbies after working full time, and can't get out of poverty while working full time either.\n\nMeanwhile, shitstains like Bezos make $13 billion in a single day, which is so much money his great-great-grandchildren will never need to work a single day in their lives and will have unduly strong influence over people that do need to work, just due to how there is a finite amount of money in the world.\n\nAny more questions you wanna ask?", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1626865546.0, "parent_id": "t1_h5zfhj8", "replies": [{"author": "FalconRelevant", "id": "h60fb91", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Archon", "submission": "oogk0j", "stickied": false, "body": "I agree that Bezos is a shitstain, I don't agree that the valuation of his stocks rising is equivalent to \"making money\" like he's actually sitting on top of piles of cash that're increasing on their own.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1626880506.0, "parent_id": "t1_h5zn4fd", "replies": []}, {"author": "FalconRelevant", "id": "h60eewq", "score": 0, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Archon", "submission": "oogk0j", "stickied": false, "body": ">I don't give a damn about the distinction between stocks, and assets and liquid.\n\nYou don't give a damn about one of the most important points?
