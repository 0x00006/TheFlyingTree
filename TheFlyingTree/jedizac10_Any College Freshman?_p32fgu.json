And this is coming from someone who was \"sheltered\" and overprotected growing up. I wasn't homesick. Then with each passing year, I felt more and more homesick, and that continued into law school. I even chose my law school in part based on how easy it'd be to go home sometimes and how far it was from Chicago. I'm not from Chicago, but my sister lives there and we were close back then, and I knew my parents would be able to come to Chicago. I got on the Amtrak train to Chicago once a month most of the time I was in law school. I got into an Ivy League school for law school, but those schools being in the Northeast are out of the way and it'd make it harder/more expensive to see family often. \n\nAdvice: don't take any of the credit cards that are offered to you. At some schools, people will come and set up tables to try to get students to sign up for credit cards, and then those students use them and run up CC debt. And join organizations. Good way to meet others, especially early in the semester before people get cliquey.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628794985.0, "parent_id": "t3_p32fgu", "replies": []}, {"author": "BrynneRaine", "id": "h8vb8bb", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Druid #13", "submission": "p32fgu", "stickied": false, "body": "I have a space in my heart for Iowa State.
