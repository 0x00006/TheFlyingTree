This was improved by Thomas Crapper into the modern U-Bend, introduced 1880.\n\nWhy do they both have names that are potty humour today? No idea, but I checked and the word 'crap' existed before Crapper. I have no way of backing this up, but I reckon Crapper's family were plumbers, or the people who clean out cess pits maybe. Just off if the fact that a lot of English last names are based if what you did for a living, or your parents.\n\nNow go and tell your family this pointless bit of information during dinner, and thank me for the wonderful results.", "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/pi3v6h/weekly_tidbit_11/", "id": "pi3v6h", "author": "FnchWzrd314", "link_flair_text": "Fascinating", "num_comments": 1, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630805418.0, "comments": [{"author": "BasketCase1234567", "id": "hbo5rzn", "score": 3, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #449", "submission": "pi3v6h", "stickied": false, "body": "Cumming", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630835710.0, "parent_id": "t3_pi3v6h", "replies": []}]}
