So, it depends on context. If I'm going out west, it probably means the west coast. If I'm skiing out west, it probably means Colorado or Utah.\n\nThe point is that context matters.

I would strongly disagree.\n\nThe U.S. has been increasingly forgetting that we actually have the proud distinction of being the very first constitutionally secular country in the world. Many of our founders were Deist. Sorry Christians, Deism is not a form of Christianity. Jefferson in particular actively hated Christianity but was still secular and believed in Christians' rights to practice their religion in their own way.\n\nThe famous [\"wall of separation\" letter](https://loc.gov/loc/lcib/9806/danpre.html) was actually written by Jefferson (not a Christian) to the Danbury Baptists (Christians) to assure them that they would be free to practice Christianity in their own way ... *free of the influence of other Christians!*\n\nThe letter was intended to protect Christians from Christians and today's Christians want to tear down that wall (and largely have already done so to significant degrees).", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1626680275.0, "parent_id": "t1_h5q770f", "replies": [{"author": "DDumpTruckK", "id": "h5q8wsp", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #79", "submission": "on8mn1", "stickied": false, "body": ">I've heard of him but know next to nothing about him and don't want to know more from the sound of this.\n\nIt's definitely nicer being ignorant of ol' JP, at least up and until the point someone you care about says something really stupid that they heard Peterson say.\n\nYou know it's funny how that all works out.

He's just smart enough to convince lay-people to buy his books. Please, I beg, don't take him seriously.\n\n\"The West\" is a reference to the western world, or the culture that has arisen from the western intellectual tradition. The core of western culture comes from ancient Greece where some unique geographic and political circumstances made for fertile soil for western philosophy to emerge.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned western civilization starts with Plato/Socrates (not going to get into distinguishing the two). \nMost people know enough to credit Greece with giving the western world Democracy, but Greece is also where a lot of our notions of egalitarianism come from.\n\nA lot of people, Peterson included, like to credit Christianity for the western egalitarianism. The reasons for this range from not knowing anything about classical history to wanting to sell more books to more Christians. For the most part, early Christianity borrowed ~~a lot~~ **all** of its ethics from the Greek world, which makes perfect sense if you know the history of the period. Christianity, however, refined Greek ethics and adapted it for the common man. It took Greek egalitarianism, raised it to new heights, and spread it all over the place.\n\nAnother hallmark of western civilization is intellectual absolutism, as opposition to relativism. Edgy teens these days, and in all days past, have thought that they're clever and modern by saying things like \"everything is relative, so nothing can be known for certain\". You can make such an argument, but if you sit down and think about it for a while you'll find that this sort of epistemology gives a very non-western view of the world. For example, if everything is relative, then there can be no such thing as injustice, at least in its own stand-alone abstract sense not bound up with the will of an emperor,\n\nAnother hallmark of the west is science as we know it. You can argue that science isn't uniquely western, but you'd only be partially correct and it'd be the lesser part. Yes I know very well the technological advancements of ancient Egypt and China. They are impressive, important, and foundational in their own right. Natural Philosophy (what *science* was called before someone came up with the word) gives more than some useful technologies for solving our current problems, it gives a method, the scientific method, as a means of discovering more *absolute* (sorry for the dirty word) truths about the natural world.\n\nTL;DR:\nThe West is characterized by egalitarian ideals which have informed not only our political lives but our social lives and sense of identity; a level of absolutism that allows us to say things like \"theft is wrong\" and \"there should be things called 'laws' which have authority in their own right, and also \"true things are true independent of authority\"; and the scientific method, which if you know anything about science you'll know is more than just a convenient way of conducting a scientific test.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1626700556.0, "parent_id": "t1_h5q770f", "replies": [{"author": "DDumpTruckK", "id": "h5s4njr", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #79", "submission": "on8mn1", "stickied": false, "body": ">TL;DR: The West is characterized by egalitarian ideals which have informed not only our political lives but our social lives and sense of identity; a level of absolutism that allows us to say things like \"theft is wrong\" and \"there should be things called 'laws' which have authority in their own right, and also \"true things are true independent of authority\"; and the scientific method, which if you know anything about science you'll know is more than just a convenient way of conducting a scientific test.\n\nBut aren't you describing most if not all of the first world here?", "is_submitter": true, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1626719021.0, "parent_id": "t1_h5qz4fp", "replies": [{"author": "Cregaleus", "id": "h5s9chu", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #290", "submission": "on8mn1", "stickied": false, "body": "Yes, and the reason for this is simple: this western tradition has been enormously influential.

We can study its progression, say this and that happened; whatever, it is a describable body of knowledge that has largely shaped how you and I understand the world, our very epistemologies.\n\nFor the most part it isn't terribly important for lay-people to think in terms of \"this type of thinking, or school of thought, comes from whatever/whoever/whenever/where-ever\". Even if it is very important for this to be the case, we're far from being able to convincing lay-people to treat it as such. It takes all we've got to get the general public to study enough to accomplish a rudimentary understanding of the world as they find it, nevertheless try and understand how we got here and how it might evolve further.\n\nAs you suggested, if something becomes completely ubiquitous, what value is there in distinguishing a thing? There are insights to be had in studying how this thing called \"western civilization\" has changed over time. We know it isn't completely ubiquitous because we still call it \"Western civilization\" and not just \"civilization\", and we can draw somewhat clear lines between the progression of one and the other to its current state.\n\nPeople tend to get impassioned when talking about the meeting of western and eastern civilization, as if one might win out over the other. We already know what'll happen, they'll both die and their deaths will be greatly exaggerated. What tends to happen with any sort of body of knowledge in the face of new challenges, information, criticisms, changing dynamics, whathaveyou, is that the parts that work break free of the context of the model within-which they're first conceptualized and informs a broader scope understanding. We've watched this happen with all sorts of models of knowledge, for example evolution - I pity anyone who thinks that all there is to evolutionary theory stops with biology.\n\nIt happens quite naturally with philosophy itself. You might have heard philosophers gleefully report that philosophy is dying/dead; well, that means philosophy is doing something right. It used to be that classifying animals and fauna, measuring the stars, right from wrong, knowing how we know, all used to be philosophy until philosophers refined these bodies of knowledge far enough such that they could stand independently as their own models. The same will happen with human culture. It will become such that it is no-longer useful to describe egalitarianism within the context of western civilization, perhaps as you suggest we are already there. But if you ask about \"Western Culture\", then the historical importance of recognizing the context from which these now disparate things arose.\n\nThe reason we have quantum mechanics, and not just \"mechanics\" is because the model isn't universal. And when we have a \"universal mechanics\" or a \"unified theory\" as they call it, quantum mechanics and Newtonian physics will both be \"dead\", yet we know that whatever the universal model ends up being it will at least partially be composed of, or predict, the features of both of these distinct models.\n\nEdit:\nI'll try and make a clarifying point and say that my use of the term model is such that theories, mathematical equations, bodies-of-knowledge such as biology, Newtonian physics, Ford F150s, Beethoven's 5th, are all sorts of models.

I'm not interested in letting you twist the context of the conversation such that we're suddenly talking about race, with you on the winning side because in the context of racial discussions the side arguing that there is legitimate purpose for differentiation. The thing is, your argument is so poor that it is somewhat racist in its own right.

They've been downplaying Jefferson and even claiming that somehow Moses was one of our country's founders and that are laws are based on the Ten Commandments (only 3 of which are actually laws).\n\n>> We have a pretty overinflated national ego. We also see ourselves as having once been great, which is actually a common theme for humanity in general, the myth of a golden age.\n\n> This is indeed true. Though, I have to admit, it is far less prevalent in Europe than in the US or UK.\n\nI thought even the ancient Greeks had the concept of a mythical golden age. (google break)\n\nYup. This concept has a long history.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Age\n\n> Interestingly, it even exists in Japan to some extend, though everyone I spoke to agrees that pre-WW2 Japan was a pretty shitty place to live in. Though instead of going for a specific time, these people who cling to the past allude to some mythical time in the past when Japan was the center of the world.\n\nThe \"center of the world\" is another interesting concept. I don't think I really have any desire to go there Joules Verne style. But, living in NYC, there is sort of a feeling here that people think NYC is the center of the world, or at least the global capital. It's kind of a funny thing. But, we do have the U.N. here. So, maybe there's a small touch of reality behind the feeling.\n\n>> But, good luck picking a time when the U.S. was actually great. The MAGA people are probably thinking about the 1950s (with the Jim Crow laws) when we were able to manufacture stuff because the rest of the world had been bombed into oblivion. But, there was never a time when the U.S. did not have some pretty fucking systemic problems.\n\n> Yeah... People tend to also get pretty angry when I point that out.\n\nI'm not surprised. I don't get good responses pointing that out either.\n\n> One of my pet peeves is that until about WW2, smart people in the US would go to Europe to get their PhD as all the good universities where there (and not many PhD programs even existed in the US).\n\nI didn't know that. I do know my great uncle went to Switzerland to become a doctor because the U.S. schools had already filled up their quota of Jews. Yup. That's still in living memory. He's in his 90s but is still alive.\n\n> Yet so many people claim that all modern technology came from the US and thus English is naturally the language of science.\n\nBecause, of course it is! This is 'Murica.\n\n> Another pet peeve is that the US space program was built on the backs of abducted German scientists and engineers. And it would have taken the US probably 10 maybe even 20 years longer to get to space without them. But hardly anyone even acknowledges that von Braun was German, much less that he was not the only German from the Nazi rocket and airplane development labs who \"voluntarily\" went to the US.\n\nActually, von Braun was solidly German. But, a lot of the others were Jews and didn't leave voluntarily so much as escape.\n\n[Werner von Braun -- Tom Lehrer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjDEsGZLbio)\n\n> Oh... And the Apollo program used SI units to get to the moon.\n\nI did not know that. But, it makes a lot of sense. I was in high school in the 70s when the U.S. was failing to make the transition to the metric system.\n\nAll of our physics problems were split 50-50 between the British system (which we get wrong on the size of a gallon) and the metric system. I used to convert the ones in the British system to metric, do the problem, then convert back. It was easier that way.\n\n> All calculations were done in SI and only converted to imperial when they needed to be shown to humans (and only because the test pilots were more used to imperial than metric, which might have cost them precious seconds to interpret some output in case of an emergency).\n\nLuckily it never caused a huge problem.

I mean what did 'the west' mean back then?  What would be the tick boxes to fill in order to be 'the west' Capitalism?  Neolibereral?  Iran was democratic (well a republic) and fairly neolib in the 80s.  They even say the nation had 'westernized' but obviously I take issue with that word, since even to this day they're not considered a 'western nation' even though they 'westernized'.  Which kind of supports my thesis even more.  Why can a country 'westernize' and still not be a 'western civilization?'  Is it because the people who use the term 'westernize' are either intentionally or unintentionally trying to paint democracy as something that came from what ever 'the west' means?

Is Chinese food 'western culture'?  It's all over the US.  What about Mexican food?  What about Sushi?  What about peirogies?  These are foods from everywhere, they exist in almost all cultures.

What kind of food is 'western style food'?  Because again, Chinese food is all over the US.  Is that western food?  Chinese culture exists in the US, is Chinese considered western culture?  The problem with identifying anything as 'western' is you're making an assumption that doesn't reflect reality.\n\n>It\u2019s a generalization that\u2019s only being used to categorize a difference in taste.\n\nIt's a generalization that *ignores* certain things that the user of the term wants to ignore, despite the things they're ignoring having a perfectly strong foothold in 'western culture'.  I live in Pennsylvania.  I can have sfougato for breakfast, tacos for lunch, and pork and sauerkraut for dinner.  I can go and get a kebab, or have some pierogis.  I can have Chinese food, sushi, Indian, Thai, or literally anything.  I live in western culture, and these are the foods I eat, so what exactly is 'western style food'?  The generalization of 'western style food' is excluding those foods as 'ethnic' yet they're as American as apple pie is.  That's where it's racist: to use the term is making a certain assumption that doesn't really align with reality.\n\nNow is it the same kind of racism as if I went to China, painted myself yellow, squinted at everyone and made incredibly offensive interpretations of their language?  No. It's not the same.  But it's still using a term to exclude a certain group of people that in reality really ought to be included.\n\n>For the instance of religion.

There's at least 5 Sikh community buildings within an hour of me.  There's a [Pagoda in Reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pagoda_(Reading,_Pennsylvania)).  Though it's only a visitor center that's never open any more :(\n\nAnd to be clear, I'm not calling you a racist, nor do I think you're intending to be malicious when you use the term.  However, there's a certain stereotyping that is happening even if you're ignorant to it, when you use the term like that.\n\nIt all reminds me of when I was in University in a history 300-level class.  The student next to me, also a history major (you don't take 300-level history classes unless you're aiming for a degree there), had \"Manifest Destiny\" tattooed on his arm.  I was blown away that someone would put a phrase permanently on their arm that references a period that disenfranchised so many people.  I was further blown away that he seemed completely ignorant of what that phrase actually implies. To an educated history student, he might as well have tattooed a swastika on his arm and gone around saying \"Yeah I don't really know what it means tho.\"", "is_submitter": true, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1626729665.0, "parent_id": "t1_h5sqtbb", "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"author": "018118055", "id": "h5sec7b", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #215", "submission": "on8mn1", "stickied": false, "body": "Paraphrasing Gandhi, I think it's a good idea.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1626723179.0, "parent_id": "t3_on8mn1", "replies": [{"author": "DDumpTruckK", "id": "h5sk4zd", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #79", "submission": "on8mn1", "stickied": false, "body": "What is a good idea?", "is_submitter": true, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1626725676.0, "parent_id": "t1_h5sec7b", "replies": [{"author": "018118055", "id": "h5skez9", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #215", "submission": "on8mn1", "stickied": false, "body": "Western culture.\n\nGandhi was once asked what he thought about Western civilization.

But western and Asian stories tend to have different tropes. In Asian stories, villains tend to be people with good intentions who are misguided, while western stories tend to have villains who are just irredeemably evil. Asian stories often have teams of heros, each with a specialty, including one who doesn't get along with the leader until the end, while western stories tend to have a single hero or a more homogenous group. Asian stories tend to more heavily feature Confucian values like filial piety, while western stories don't feature them as much.\n\nYou are of course going to find big exceptions to these, but that doesn't mean that they are not a *tendencies* that can make for interesting discussion and university courses.

Ever seen IP Man? Pretty blatantly evil guy there from Asian movies.  Ever seen Marvel Avengers?  Tons of characters in a team of heroes.  Ever seen Kagemusha?  Asian film with one hero, not a team.
