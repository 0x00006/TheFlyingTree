Even thought I haven't faced this, I think I can still understand it, if just a bit. Well first of all, this is the Internet. You can do literally anything you want here (except illegal stuff, don't do that). So people's behaviour here tends to be different from how they behave IRL. Their tolerance for opposing opinions and arguments gets reduced significantly. Why? Because no one cares. It doesn't matter. No one knows who you are.\n\nAside from this, people SUCK at putting themselves in the other person's shoes. No one thinks, \"Oh why did they say that? They must have had a reason.\" or \"Even thought it's a different opinion, it may have some truth/logic to it. I should think about this.\"\n\nThird thing is, pride. If you were to say something, and someone points out the flaws in it, you will become defensive. Even if you acknowledge the faults, you wont publicly accept it, because then it would show gaps in your knowledge, and its acknowledging the fact that you are inferior or the one who pointed out the flaws. Of course, this is not a healthy attitude, people should learn how to accept their mistakes. But its still REALLY common.\n\nAll of this is just my observation.
