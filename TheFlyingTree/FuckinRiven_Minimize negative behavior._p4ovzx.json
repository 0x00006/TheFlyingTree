Your views may be hard to swallow, but how easy or difficult it is to accept your ideas depends on the person you're talking to. For example, I have highly logical friends. We have completely, or at least different views on society, but we can talk about these potentially hard to swallow things that would upset many people without any problems. So I'd say here that you shouldn't suppress your beliefs, because as you said, they are who you are, to an extent.\n\nOn the other hand, however, it is important to be aware of other people's sensitivities. If the people you talk to about this stuff cannot handle it well, it might be a good idea to not talk to them about it.
