It's going to have four buttons. My issue at the moment is trying to work out if I should use plastic buttons, or wooden buttons. The wood will probably look better, but the plastic may be more practical in terms of being able to wash the thing.\n\nBig decisions ahead. I've easily put forty hours into this thing so far.

For starters, if it's a wool yarn, dry cleaning is better for the fiber anyway--wool tends to shrink when washed. Wood is also more environmentally friendly and, as you said, looks better. If you've already put so much effort into this project, might as well go the extra mile and spring for wood!\n\n...that last sentence sounded a lot less dirty in my head.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629826279.0, "parent_id": "t3_p9tx0o", "replies": []}]}
