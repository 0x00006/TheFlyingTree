It gave me a pleasure. Memories captured in a picture, that made me smile. Last year I found the hobby of analog photography and it just keeps giving. Sure it\u2019s expensive and every picture needs to count so it\u2019s no wasted money, but tbh that is the focal point! Waiting for the pictures and be thrilled about how they gonna turn out and then sort them into albums so the memory is stored!", "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/p4i4hf/saturday_night/", "id": "p4i4hf", "author": "tangomarkIII", "link_flair_text": "User Made", "num_comments": 5, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628982313.0, "comments": [{"author": "BasilDream", "id": "h8yuii2", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #163 | Classis Veritatus", "submission": "p4i4hf", "stickied": false, "body": "Yeah, my old film pictures are developed and (mostly) in albums but all the digital ones are just in my computer or in the cloud somewhere and they never end up getting printed out.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628982876.0, "parent_id": "t3_p4i4hf", "replies": [{"author": "tangomarkIII", "id": "h8yur9m", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #10", "submission": "p4i4hf", "stickied": false, "body": "I don\u2019t have them digital i just have the negatives and the printed once so it keeps the special \u201etouch\u201c because I never look at pictures in my phone (I don\u2019t have a computer) I like to have things physically so it\u2019s, stupidly said, real", "is_submitter": true, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628982997.0, "parent_id": "t1_h8yuii2", "replies": [{"author": "BasilDream", "id": "h8yv7vy", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #163 | Classis Veritatus", "submission": "p4i4hf", "stickied": false, "body": "That is exactly what I meant.
