I commented on the fact that I can never get the lumps out, but I drank it anyways, like I always do, because who has time for a blender? Not me.\n\nSo then, my friend goes: \"You don't like the lumps? Watch this.\"\n\nHe puts one scoop of protein powder into a glass and then puts just a tiny amount of water in, with a fork, he mixes them into a thick paste. Of course the lumps can't escape this way, it all gets pulverized into homogeneity. Once he had a lump-free paste, he added the rest of the water and voila: lump free protein shake, no blender required. Took him less than a minute.\n\nIt was so simple and obvious I can't believe what an idiot I am for not figuring it out myself. I have the IQ of a clever housefly and I can't even walk upside down on the ceiling.
