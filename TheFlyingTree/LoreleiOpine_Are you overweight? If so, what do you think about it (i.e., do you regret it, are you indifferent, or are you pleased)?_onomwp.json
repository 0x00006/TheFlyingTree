My mother was bulimic and obsessed with her weight. Her mom was obese. My dad's parents were obese. My mom would force me and my siblings to eat everything on our plates. We lived in the Southern U.S. so everything was fried and filled with sugar. I didn't know vegetables could taste good until I was an adult and learned to steam them and NOT drown them in butter or cheese. So, lots of childhood bad eating habits.\n\nI was in beauty pageants as a child...I was precocious and pretty. Then puberty hit and my breast grew to DDs in just a couple of years. I got way too much creepy attention from adult men. Then, I was sexually assaulted. I was ashamed of my body and started gaining weight because fat people don't get raped as much. Depression and PTSD put me on disability during my 20s. Depression and poverty food is high in starch and sugar. I didn't know how to cook healthy food...it was never modeled for me. Cook books called for ingredients that were too expensive for someone on food stamps. \n\nIn my 40s, I started working out and lost a lot of weight. Then I fucked up my back, had surgery and it took me a long time to get literally back on my feet.\n\nI've been slowly losing the weight again and I'm in therapy trying to deal with the trauma part of my mind that thinks that being fat is safer. \n\nEvery fat person knows they are fat. Calling them names and shaming them isn't the hot take you think it is. Shame is what keeps me fat, not what will help me lose it. Creepy men, and some creepy women, taught me to hate myself and feel ashamed of being good looking with a big rack.\n\nThese aren't excuses...they are reasons. It's a constant battle. I've taught myself how to cook healthy meals and to move/exercise each day.\n\nAll of my bloodwork consistently comes back as normal. I don't have high blood pressure or diabetes. I'm pretty healthy other than the obesity. You can ask my bosses if I'm lazy and they would laugh at you. My house is always clean.

It's a constant issue for her self esteem and she has stated herself \"I hate fat people. That includes myself.\" She cannot see herself as attractive, even when I tell her I find her beautiful her most common answer is \"That's your opinion man.\"\n\nIt's quite discouraging but it's getting better. She's slowly but surely losing weight, and I'm happy for her. Because she's always so stoked that some old shirt fits her again, and I just want to see her happy and confident. I know that will take a long time, but I don't mind. I find her attractive now, and I know I will still find her attractive when she loses weight.\n\nIt does cause some issues my way though. As said, I'm not overweight myself,  but I'm not skinny or fit either. I have some extra pounds, thighs that rub together etc. I didn't used to care about it before getting into a relationship with her. My relationship with my own body used to be \"I don't care. I'm me and that's enough!\" Because I was raised with a lot of bodypositivity around me. \n\nAt the early stages of our relationship, when my fiancee was just a girlfriend, she did tell me that she would break up with me if I ever got fat. I don't know if she remembers that anymore...but I do. And now whenever I notice I've gained even a bit, it makes me anxious about if she will stop loving me soon. If 6 years together can be erased just by some kilos.\n\nSo... I don't think it's exactly good for either of us.
