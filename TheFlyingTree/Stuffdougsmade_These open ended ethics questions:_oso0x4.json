{"title": "These open ended ethics questions:", "name": "t3_oso0x4", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/oso0x4/these_open_ended_ethics_questions/", "selftext": "It seems like since yesterday (at least since I\u2019ve seen, maybe longer) permutations of this same question are being posed repeatedly which very quickly turns to a semantic argument. Perhaps just focusing on the semantics first might lead to the actual question. \n\nI think a lot of people for whom the question and the way it\u2019s stated make total sense see someone take issue with the semantics and think \u201crabble rouser, they know what the thrust of the questions intent is, you can answer it in those terms.\u201d  I assure you, that is definitely not the case for everyone. Perhaps some people delight in finding any small place to be \u201cright\u201d but definitely not everyone. \n\nI used to be principled to a fault, or at least believe I was. I also believed that fundamentally people don\u2019t really change. Then I became a father, then an addict, then sober, then an alcoholic, then actually recovered (or recovering). Some of those shifts required invisible changes to my principles, some of them were justified by my principles, it wasn\u2019t until the last one that I realized that all of it is plastic and, while not fungible, almost entirely a matter of perspective. \n\nWhen discussions of morality come into play and it quickly devolves into a semantic argument it isn\u2019t because no one wants to play the game, it\u2019s because the prompt wasn\u2019t stated in clear enough terms for everyone to understand the rules of the game. \n\nMaybe think of a concrete example (ie your wife and your mother both hang from your hands over the side of a cliff and you can only save one) that forces the confrontation of one against the other?  Or we could simply discuss principles and what they mean\u2026virtue, valor, bravery, cowardice. I think all those topics could be interesting on their own and produce a less antagonistic back and forth as some people try to steer discussion back to the OP.", "score": 11, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/oso0x4/these_open_ended_ethics_questions/", "id": "oso0x4", "author": "Stuffdougsmade", "link_flair_text": "Idea", "num_comments": 57, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1627396504.0, "comments": [{"author": "Kelyaan", "id": "h6qmzke", "score": 6, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #271 | Consortii Concordus", "submission": "oso0x4", "stickied": false, "body": "The person making them needs to learn to write properly - Making a title is not how you get an even discussion going on ethical topics, it's just Falcon being a pleb.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1627412583.0, "parent_id": "t3_oso0x4", "replies": [{"author": "FalconRelevant", "id": "h6smtok", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Archon", "submission": "oso0x4", "stickied": false, "body": "Okay, acolyte.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1627447485.0, "parent_id": "t1_h6qmzke", "replies": [{"author": "Kelyaan", "id": "h6u09eo", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #271 | Consortii Concordus", "submission": "oso0x4", "stickied": false, "body": "See, My point - This guy has no fucking idea, He even think \"Ok acolyte\" is a rebuttal to anything.

We inherited these instincts and behaviors from our ancestors via natural selection. Some of our behaviors are derivatives of other, more basic instincts.\n\nThere are many ways in which people have expressed these thoughts. Stephen Woodford calls them [axiomatic oughts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJSLvTN7pys). LessWrong calls it [dialectical moral argumentation](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HLJGabZ6siFHoC6Nh/sam-harris-and-the-is-ought-gap). Whatever way you view it, I'd argue that the objective facts about ethics for every species are already embedded within them via their respective evolutionary histories and their biological structure. Hume showed that we can't derive our ethics from descriptive facts, so we might as well just understand what the facts are, including the facts about what our instincts and behaviors already are, then move on from there.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1627423013.0, "parent_id": "t1_h6qvb9u", "replies": [{"author": "Cregaleus", "id": "h6rhgmg", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #290", "submission": "oso0x4", "stickied": false, "body": ">If you put your naked hand on a stove eye that's been left on high for the last hour, you'll take it off almost immediately.

We inherited these instincts and behaviors from our ancestors via natural selection. Some of our behaviors are derivatives of other, more basic instincts.\n\nI agree. As far as I can tell all socially learned behavior is derived from some expressed instinct. The problem with this is that increasingly as we have become more social animals with complex social frameworks, such as law codes and government, our base instincts are less useful for determining the \"right\" course of action. Instincts inform a set of judgements, which informs its own set of judgements, and on we go with the evolution of culture. Cultures can develop differently from each-other, with their own sets of judgements. Beyond that, are we to equate that which is instinctual with that which is moral? My instinct is to go to the kitchen and eat every single cookie in the jar; can anything about morality be said of that instinct? How many people do we have locked away in prisons because they acted upon their baser instincts and ended up violating some cultural (and so subjective) rules?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I'd argue that the objective facts about ethics for every species are already embedded within them via their respective evolutionary histories and their biological structure\n\nThere are objective facts about instinctive behavior for every species, but I am very hesitant to make moral claims about instincts. I just don't think instinctual behavior has anything to do with ethics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Hume showed that we can't derive our ethics from descriptive facts, so we might as well just understand what the facts are, including the facts about what our instincts and behaviors already are, then move on from there.\n\nQuite right. I don't see how this precludes moral relativism. We live in a society with our instincts and a framework of behaviors learned from our culture. That culture is filled with judgements that are inconsistent with judgements made in other cultures such that true statements made in the context of one might be false within the context of another, so relative.\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but your argument seems hinge on the premise that instinctual behavior has anything to do with morality. I'm not dead-set on my position, but I'm inclined to believe that it doesn't. For example, is it moral or amoral for a dog to salivate when you put a piece of meat in its mouth? Is it moral or amoral for that dog to salivate when you ring a bell after conditioning said dog to associate the bell with the presentation of food?", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1627426195.0, "parent_id": "t1_h6rakg0", "replies": [{"author": "jmcsquared", "id": "h6rn73g", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #256 | Classis Veritatus", "submission": "oso0x4", "stickied": false, "body": ">Quite right.

You and I have similar instincts for not wanting to be assaulted, wanting to eat good food, etcetera. This means that it's possible, within reasonable limits, to argue that certain cultures do in fact have practices that cause their inhabitants unnecessary suffering, mental anguish, or anxiety.
