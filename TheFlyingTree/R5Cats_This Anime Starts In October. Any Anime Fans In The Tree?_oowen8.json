There's a concerning amount of Naiz Weeaboos that enjoy those highschool anime girls.  Just gets a bit creepy if you ask me.\n\nTypically I don't like Anime.  I find it is insultingly hand-holdy and ruins any decent moment they'd been building to by having the characters excruciatingly flatly narrate every single detail that you already know.  It's like they expect you to not have watched the show.  I couldn't stand Full Metal Alchemist for this.  Any interesting or elaborate plot element they included was immediately ruined by having the characters do their 20 minute long monologue explaining everything as if I was the dumbest person in the world.\n\nI also can't stand giant swords, characters that all look the same, or silly gimmicky artistic designs that aren't really necessary.\n\nThat said, Cowboy Bebop is great and it's the only anime I'll watch sincerely or suggest to anyone.  For any other anime the most value I can get out of it is watching it the same way I'd watch The Room.

It's not necessarily that they're ridiculous that bothers me.  It's that statistically it seems like regular swords don't exist.  EVERYONE needs a giant sword.  There can be ok moments to stylistically use a giant sword, but everyone sharing their armory with Cloud Strife is pretty lame.\n\n>There's some anime that explain nothing, things happen without any 'why' or how. \n\nIf its written well, it shouldn't need explaining.
