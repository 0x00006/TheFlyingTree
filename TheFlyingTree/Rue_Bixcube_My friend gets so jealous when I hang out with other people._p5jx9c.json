I don't get angry with him when he does stuff without me, but If I go out with friends and he's not involved he gets so upset. He will complain about it for months at a time and it's the only thing he will talk about. He will just keep bringing it up over and over again. At this point I just try not to tell him about it but then he finds out and gets so nasty about it. I mean I can't involve him with every single thing I do. I hung out with him all night Friday night, then Saturday I went to some else's place to hang out and he found out about it and started sending me angry text messages because I didn't invite him. I'm dreading seeing him at this point because I know he's going to be such an ass hole about it.
