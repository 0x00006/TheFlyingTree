Where are you thinking your life is headed? *sigh* If you\u2019re one of those family members, I bet you\u2019re not sleeping. I don\u2019t even think My Pillow can do it. MyPillow dot com. That\u2019s where I go. I fall asleep faster, I stay asleep longer. These are going to be a lot of sleepless nights for so many of our fellow Americans. We\u2019ve got to get them home. We\u2019ll be right back after a commercial break.\u201d \n\nSean Hannity sighs again after finishing his latest commercial before a commercial break. He turns to his producers and unpaid interns and says \u201calright I\u2019m going to need you all to get out during the 5 minute ad break. I need a little bit of Sean time again\u201d\n\nAfter they exit, Sean turns, in a somber sulking fashion, to the swiveling office chair that holds the mid-sized mirror he always keeps around. \n\nHe begins the Incantation to summon the god controlling his actions , Yog-sothoth.\n\n\u201cRepublico powerfoe noe mo rume foe de Poe tu goe\u201d\n\nA rumbling sound shakes the studio, which is not unusual at this point, and Yog-sothoth appears on the mirror, visually blinding Sean hannity and destabilizing his cognitive functions more than usual.\n\nYog-Sothoth is displeased and says \u201c why have you summoned me mortal\u201d\n\n\u201cSir, I did as you asked. I plugged the my pillow product again\u201d \n\nYog-sothoth replies \u201cfool. Such a blatant connection to tragedy and mypillow will alert the ones who are not true followers of divinity.. and my children will never get the chance to exist on this plane. You have yet again disappointed me. Do better on the next ad break or you will suffer consequences\u201d \n\nThe mirror starts bleeding and breaks into pieces in the chair. Sean becomes unconscious for the remaining 2 minutes of ad breaks.", "score": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/p7ds4n/a_real_sean_hannity_story/", "id": "p7ds4n", "author": "HolisticHolograms", "link_flair_text": "Fascinating", "num_comments": 6, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629375836.0, "comments": [{"author": "justausername22222", "id": "h9iwut4", "score": 6, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #165", "submission": "p7ds4n", "stickied": false, "body": "Fun fact: Sean Hannity has a television studio in his basement so he can do his show from home without commuting into the city.
