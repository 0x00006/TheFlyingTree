{"title": "Let's talk about cars", "name": "t3_p29f44", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/p29f44/lets_talk_about_cars/", "selftext": "I have a good number of car things going on right now, myself.  The big one is that my car (a C5 or so Audi A6 2.7T) is in the shop for a rather drawn out and expensive clutch rebuild.  I've known the clutch was going to die eventually since I got the car, of course, but it started seriously slipping about a month or so ago.  You could feel it getting worse as you were driving, so it was either that, or buy a replacement, and to be honest I *really* like that car.  Two turbos, AWD, slip protection that literally lets you steer on ice as if it were dry pavement, and the six speed manual gearbox.  Anyway, I'm having it repaired.  It's hard to find a manual version of that car, and mine is the last year they made them.  I'll probably keep it for a good while longer if I can manage.  ... but of course it's never that simple.  The mechanics had to order some shift linkages that were also wearing down, some engine mounting bits that were rusted, and the exhaust system was in pretty bad shape too.  All reasonable, but of course they had to wait a day or two a couple times for all the parts, and then they ordered at least one wrong one, so they had to re-order that.  They tell me everything is back in except the exhaust now, the car runs and shifts and things are going fine, so maybe it will be done any time.\n\nIn addition, we've bought a truck recently.  It's a second generation Ram 2500 that used to be a railroad maintenance vehicle until recently.  It has the 5.9L gasoline engine in it, automatic transmission, flashing orange emergency strobe, spotlight, big Knapheide frame built into the back with tons of toolboxes and what not built in.  Otherwise it's quite spartan, even to the point of having manual windows and no AC.  Needs a good cleaning.  Also a number of other things: The rear window latch is busted, the head liner is hanging down in spots, the cabin is leaking a bit of water, the plastic of the dash is breaking apart in places.  It has some rust spots; bit of exhaust rot too, out past the muffler where it doesn't matter all that much yet.  Mostly minor annoyances.  When we got it the drivers side seat adjust mechanism was seized up and would not work.  I fixed that, and I've started on a couple of the other things.  The difference in acceleration between the Audi and the Dodge is, well, substantial.  That's not surprising, since trucks are geared for torque, but I'm wondering whether it can't do a bit better.  The factory air box sets right on top of the engine so it seems like an aftermarket air intake might be dead simple.  I have a kit with the right pipes on order as well as a K&N high flow filter.  Either it will help, or it will not hurt and save me a bit of money on filter replacements.  Could probably use a tune up too.\n\nAnyway, what has everyone else got going on?", "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/p29f44/lets_talk_about_cars/", "id": "p29f44", "author": "zoharel", "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "num_comments": 24, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628673072.0, "comments": [{"author": "ISTP_Loner", "id": "h8iojjo", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #153", "submission": "p29f44", "stickied": false, "body": "Back in the 80\u2019s I had a mercury Lynx wagon with a manual transmission.
