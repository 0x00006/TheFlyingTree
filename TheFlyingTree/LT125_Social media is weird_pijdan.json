FTFY.\n\nReddit doesn\u2019t really count in what I perceive as \u201csocial media\u201d as it\u2019s more of a chat room with nothing but anons.  Things like Facebook, tictok, and the like where you have your name and face attached is what I\u2019m referring to and it\u2019s the worst.  I don\u2019t know it\u2019s just a different vibe, I guess since it\u2019s attached more to the \u201creal\u201d you the ego is more easily spurred to action for recognition and fame so more stupidity is spewed and performed in order to get recognition or to \u201cdefend\u201d your stance, and when someone disagrees there is a face and name to attach to whatever dis or hurt you perceived to be directed to you, even if it\u2019s not.  You don\u2019t really hear about Reddit challenges where people hurt or kill themselves and others for views and get convicted of crimes.

I can see the commercial & propaganda value that social media has. For me the social aspects are limited. Ignorance of internet jargon & the tech dexterity of a sloth in winter are likely explanations. Instincts suggest a strategic retreat is advisable. Turtle mode is best during troubled times! Undaunted by the revelation of what the glockenspiel is, will continue to research the history of all the instruments in the orchestra. Glockenspiel just rolls off the tongue & caresses the ears! However the reality is incredibly drab! Orchestral bells that resemble bars of metal. Sigh. Today I will learn about the hurdy  gurdy. Dipping my toe in the pool of public opinion does not inspire me to jump right in. Will return to my blanket & umbrella near the exterior fence & observe from there. Each of us is weird & capable of behaviour that is out of character, given the right stimuli or circumstances. Everything is random. Human nature is predictable. Am not sufficiently interested in myself to investigate all the nuances of mbti for self analysis. Have existing but proven methods for reading others. When doing job interviews, I read the person more than their resumes. Words printed are even more unreliable than words verbalised as a guide for judging a person. Body language, eyes, facial expressions and voice are more reliable for perceiving the colour of a persons soul. Deliberate deception causes a subconscious twang. Like one musician in a orchestra playing out of tune or time. Change subject and discuss something random to thwart the use of pre planned statements or set plays.
