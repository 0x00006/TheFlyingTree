Maybe someone here knows the piece I'm looking for.\n\nThe most vivid thing I remember is that it starts with a violin playing the exact same note over and over again for like 30 seconds. The whole piece of music is probably about 8-10 minutes, and after the beginning violin part, it has a sweet, pastoral feeling. It is a very soft, peaceful song. Then in the last couple of minutes it sounds sort of like marching music, like the type of music from Les Miserables. I thought it may have been by Vivaldi, but after looking at some of his songs on YouTube, I couldn't find the one I'm looking for. I know this is very vague, but I would love to hear this piece of music again. I'm including a sequencer of the beginning part, but as I said before, it's all the same note repeated, so it probably won't help much.
