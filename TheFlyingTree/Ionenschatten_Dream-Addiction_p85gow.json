I lack a general enjoyment in life.\n\nNow, dreams. I consume a lot of different media. Strange indie music, movie, shows, youtube videos, games and books. And when I sleep my mind gets to processing things. \n\nI dream a lot and really livid. Each dream has the magnitude of an alternate reality, a book, a videogame or a drug-trip. \n\nI've recently tried going back to school but the stress is crushing and when I come home in the evening I am incredibly exhausted and tired. Sleep doesn't fix anything but yet when I dream I forget all of my stress and pain.\n\nAnd enter a new world. It's better than VR. You don't even know it's a dream. One time you're a member of a biking tribe living in an icy forest hunting and gathering, then the other day you're a teenager in a giant megacity that finds an old mecha in an abandoned warehouse and have to run from the patrolling police. \n\nNightmares can be endlessly twisted caves that turn into each other and defy logic, causing an endless path of twisting pain and disorientation but also they can be normal. A day at school. It's too hot. Really dusty. The teacher talks for 80 hours. Nothing happens. Hours pass. Nothing happens.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs much as I enjoy these dreams they're all fictional and just a construction of my mind using past experiences. They don't help me in live at all and sleeping too much gives me a headache and a feeling of a lot of wasted time. I forget to work out or to eat. \n\nWhat do you think about dreaming or my way of dreaming?
