If you will just upload the brain you will get not what you want. That is because the brain uses hormones that come from alltroughout the body. So my theorie is that the brain will work like a computer program that can't achive it's goal. Because humans are designed to keep the species alive that is their sole purpose. So we would most likely need to creat a new entity that has a goal that fits it. And like I said earlyer we would likely need to upload the whole body( and probably even the enviroment, for hormones and so on to be simulated properly). So what would a simulated human do? I don't know myself but their goal wouldn't be achivabel so, to function properly, wouldn't a human just get loaded into a matrix? The human might be good and could control it's enviroment, but that would get boring as soon as the imagenation and the creativity have nothing more to try out. So in the long run the human would just live longer, try everything out and then want to be deleted. So, it would rather be creating and entity fit for the purpose of existing for almost forever and upload our expiriences to that entity, and that would then be the new version of the human that would live forever. The entity suitable for something like that would be an AI that would use human concepts( like not just exterminating a species, having morals and things like that) and get an human expirience \"pack\" uploaded to it so it would gain a personality, or to say it short, a human that doesen't has needs like food,water,fun,sex or relationships( I'm sure I forgot things, but you should het the idea) or any stimuli from the outside world to function properly.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1627560812.0, "parent_id": "t1_h6x264p", "replies": []}]}, {"author": "dashingThroughSnow12", "id": "h6wrpfa", "score": 3, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #24", "submission": "otk44j", "stickied": false, "body": "> I don't think it's possible.

At that point, toxic quantities of hydrogen sulfide gas were released into the atmosphere turning the sky green by changing the refraction of the atmosphere. This brought the mass extinction onto land.\n\nIf we don't take very strong and decisive action on climate change, we will cause another such extinction event. And, we will not survive.\n\n[Stanford Earth Matters magazine: What caused Earth's biggest mass extinction?](https://earth.stanford.edu/news/what-caused-earths-biggest-mass-extinction#gs.7maype)\n\n[Full length book on the subject: Under a Green Sky by Peter Ward](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/630144.Under_a_Green_Sky)\n\nDuring mass extinction events, large warmblooded species fare very poorly. We are large and warmblooded.\n\nSo far, I see zero evidence of us taking climate change seriously. And, we don't have much time any more. In the 1980s, we could have made incremental changes to get where we needed to go. Now, we need bold and radical change in a big fat hurry. We're already seeing horrific effects today.\n\nSo, let's solve climate change, which is our most immediate problem. Then, we can talk about whether we might survive. Right now, I don't think so.\n\nAs for civilization rather than survival of the species, that's a very different question.\n\nSource: [Deforestation and world population sustainability: a quantitative analysis](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-63657-6)\n\nExcerpt from the Conclusion section (emphasis mine):\n\n> Calculations show that, maintaining the actual rate of population growth and resource consumption, in particular forest consumption, **we have a few decades left** before an irreversible collapse of our civilisation (see Fig. 5). Making the situation even worse, we stress once again that **it is unrealistic to think that the decline of the population in a situation of strong environmental degradation would be a non-chaotic and well-ordered decline.** This consideration leads to an even shorter remaining time. Admittedly, in our analysis, we assume parameters such as population growth and deforestation rate in our model as constant. This is a rough approximation which allows us to predict future scenarios based on current conditions. Nonetheless **the resulting mean-times for a catastrophic outcome to occur, which are of the order of 2\u20134 decades** (see Fig. 5), make this approximation acceptable, as it is hard to imagine, in absence of very strong collective efforts, big changes of these parameters to occur in such time scale.\n\nIMHO, the future is looking rather grim. We seem incapable of taking science seriously and caring enough about our own survival to actually do anything to ensure it.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1627539123.0, "parent_id": "t3_otk44j", "replies": [{"author": "DELETED", "id": "h6xwbvi", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": null, "submission": "otk44j", "stickied": false, "body": "[deleted]", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1627555476.0, "parent_id": "t1_h6xd3ko", "replies": [{"author": "MisanthropicScott", "id": "h6y76e4", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Druid #6 | Ordo Cognitus", "submission": "otk44j", "stickied": false, "body": "95% of all multicellular species went extinct at that time.\n\nLife will pull through in the post-human era.
