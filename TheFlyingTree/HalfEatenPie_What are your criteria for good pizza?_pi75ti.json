My friends told me the pizza was good but it wasn't the \"best in the area\", but others were conflicted on what's the best local pizza place was (there isn't even that many places around here).  \n\nBut what really makes pizza the \"best pizza\"?  What criteria are you grading it on?  Is it on the quality of the cheese?  Is it the flavor of the sauce?  The texture of the crust?  How well the toppings work with the whole pie?  \n\nHow do you rate a pizza?", "score": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/pi75ti/what_are_your_criteria_for_good_pizza/", "id": "pi75ti", "author": "HalfEatenPie", "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "num_comments": 27, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630819640.0, "comments": [{"author": "shmiddy555", "id": "hbnnxym", "score": 7, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #218", "submission": "pi75ti", "stickied": false, "body": "It taste good, I like it = good pizza.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630820642.0, "parent_id": "t3_pi75ti", "replies": []}, {"author": "BelowAvgPhysicist_02", "id": "hbnnewf", "score": 7, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #267", "submission": "pi75ti", "stickied": false, "body": "Any pizza without pineapple is a good pizza imo.\n\nI\u2019ve low standards I guess, lol", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630820262.0, "parent_id": "t3_pi75ti", "replies": [{"author": "HalfEatenPie", "id": "hbnnlix", "score": 3, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #597", "submission": "pi75ti", "stickied": false, "body": "Haha well hey as long as you're happy I don't see a problem with it!\n\nMy girlfriend loves pizza with pineapples.

So, prior to the 80's, we had fewer national pizza chains and more regional variation in pizza styles. This resulted in multiple ideas of what \"good\" pizza was. Each region had different, conflicting priorities. During the 80's-90's national chains began to develop. This started out as a particular chain spreading their region's pizza further around the nation, but this inevitably began to come up against conflicting tastes. This led to the next phase. \n\nNo, follow me here, when the national chains began to notice that their pizza's we not doing well in a certain area, they had two choices. Continue their original recipe and lose out on some sales... or modify their recipe just a bit to make it more palatable to more people. I think that this had the net effect of making national pizza chains just generally more bland so as to be less offensive to more people. This led to the phase we find ourselves in now. \n\nNow, we have the situation of a generation of people being brought up on the more available, usually cheaper, national brands instead of their previous local variety. This actually induced pressure on some local establishments to make their pizza more like the national brands to compete, which cut down on the number of \"authentic\" regional pizza places. All of this makes it difficult to agree on what makes a good pizza because our baseline is a weird mediocre mix of attributes meant to appeal to everyone instead of something unique that might be disliked by some.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630845003.0, "parent_id": "t3_pi75ti", "replies": []}, {"author": "HumanoidDespair", "id": "hboi6nj", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #565", "submission": "pi75ti", "stickied": false, "body": "Only cheese, spices, vegetables, and mushrooms.
