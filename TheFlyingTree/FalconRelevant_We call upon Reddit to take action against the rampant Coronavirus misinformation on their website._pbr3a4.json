[Latest study on blood clotting.](https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2021-04-15-risk-rare-blood-clotting-higher-covid-19-vaccines) The increase risk of blood clotting after getting the vaccine is similar to the increase risk of blood clotting someone has after a standard influenza infection. Fighting a covid infection increases your risk of blood clots 10x more than the vaccine though.\n\n2. It's true a very small number of vaccinated people are still going to die of covid. The fact the vaccine isn't literally 100% effective is a weird thing to criticize. It significantly improves your odds of surviving covid, as well as the chance symtoms will be mild and not require medical attention. A key takeaway from [this whitehouse briefing](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/07/01/press-briefing-by-white-house-covid-19-response-team-and-public-health-officials-43/) is that 99.5 percent of deaths from COVID-19 in these states have occurred in unvaccinated people.\n3. There isn't a cure for covid, [treating](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/treatment-vs-cure-difference#:~:text=Cure%20usually%20refers%20to%20a,the%20complete%20elimination%20of%20disease.) the symptoms to increase someone's chance of survival is not the same thing. I'm assuming you're referring to [Ivermectin](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/why-you-should-not-use-ivermectin-treat-or-prevent-covid-19) or [Hydroxychloroquine](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-cautions-against-use-hydroxychloroquine-or-chloroquine-covid-19-outside-hospital-setting-or), neither of which actually work. The people who started those lies had ties to the companies that manufacture these drugs, and have been getting rich from the deaths of people they failed to treat.\n\n4. There are so many ways to show covid is much scarier than a flu virus. If you don't think covid deaths are *that* much higher than a flu, consider that [pandemic safety measures were enough to eliminate the vast majority of flu cases in the past year.](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/season/faq-flu-season-2020-2021.htm) The fact that covid deaths are higher, even with masks/distancing/quarantines shows how much insanely easier covid is to spread than a flu.\n\n5. If you're worried about deaths being misreported, you can look at the data for the [total number of deaths from all causes](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/oqe9of/us_cdc_weekly_deaths_20142021_mar_1st_2020_jul/).
