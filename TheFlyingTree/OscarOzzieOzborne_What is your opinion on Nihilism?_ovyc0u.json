If that's true, then it's always been true. Does it 'mean' less if the meaning was invented by people? What does it mean for something to 'matter'? How can any action not matter? \n\nWhat even is 'meaning' anyway? Seems to me that there is a lot of ink and angst spent on trying to figure out what 'meaning' is. Looks a lot like a fancy way of saying 'How I feel about X'. \n\nMy personal opinion is that the search for meaning is a sociological function, not a psychological one. We seek meaning because we've been trained to look for it, not because it's actually there.
