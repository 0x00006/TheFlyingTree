I\u2019m really just trying to generate discussion to see what other people think about AI. I don\u2019t necessarily have any novel ideas I\u2019m just interested in the topic. Alternatively all ideas are just modulations on existing ideas, so perhaps there\u2019s a notion that no one has any novel ideas. Maybe ideas have just not been dictated in a way everyone can understand yet. Maybe we\u2019re all existing as encodings of symbols like brains in vats\n\nI think the key to a true artificial intelligence involves a balance between symbolic and computational techniques. Rigidly defined neural networks will never be able to make an abstract jump outside of the bounds of its training. Entirely symbolic AI would just become nonsense connections. So a network of networks that can create its own novel networks based on\n\n1.\tAn initial set of symbol definitions\n2.\tAn initial neural network trained on recognizing this arbitrary set of symbols\n3.\tAn initial set of computational methods\n4.\tAn encoding for creating new symbol definitions in its knowledge base\n5.\tAn encoding for creating new neural networks to recognize newly discovered symbols\n\nThis creates a set of 5. Perhaps there is the notion that the world and mind consists of sets of 5. Perhaps all of it is nonsense and it doesn\u2019t matter if we create artificial intelligence because we already are artificially intelligent. Or perhaps it\u2019s impossible to create intelligence, as doing so would make you a god which would impose suffering on the world. But the world is already suffering and so we must find meaning in nothing.\n\nI just like to study mathematicians like Turing and G\u00f6del, and talk philosophically about the mind", "is_submitter": true, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629734639.0, "parent_id": "t1_h9zxtec", "replies": []}]}, {"author": "John__Nash", "id": "h9zwb1e", "score": 6, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #17", "submission": "p9ripo", "stickied": false, "body": "Great, I'll start coding tomorrow.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629693791.0, "parent_id": "t3_p9ripo", "replies": [{"author": "step-lego-wat-u-doin", "id": "ha05b8u", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "", "submission": "p9ripo", "stickied": false, "body": "That's a beautiful mind for you.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629700278.0, "parent_id": "t1_h9zwb1e", "replies": []}, {"author": "SaxAppeal", "id": "ha1ozlc", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #171", "submission": "p9ripo", "stickied": false, "body": "Let me know if you do it", "is_submitter": true, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629734836.0, "parent_id": "t1_h9zwb1e", "replies": []}]}, {"author": "NoSuchKotH", "id": "ha06eck", "score": 6, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #91", "submission": "p9ripo", "stickied": false, "body": "This sounds very much like the failed \"[expert systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system)\" approach from the 70s.\n\nThe biggest obstacle in AI is that, while we know how to build neural networks that can learn, and we know how to build heuristics to classify even weird things (aka machine learning), we don't know how using knowledge to generate new knowledge would work.
