Sure, it's clean and much more efficient, but there is hardly \"global market\" for it, and solving any part of energy deficit by 2050 isn't very helpful in 2021. \n\nAlso it's simply risky investment. If i put half a billion dollars now into molten salt plant, it'll be operational in 5 years and pay itself in next 10. Setting up a bunch of reactors and hoping no new breakthrough technology will render them non-competitive in next 50 years might no be worth it, so the big money avoids it.

Those handouts come with regulations to make sure that they're not stuck with the tens of billions of dollars of maintenance and cleanup.   \n\n\nIn fact, all the people whining about government regulations being in the way, are ALSO the same people that claim because of those regulations nuclear is 'super safe.' The entire time they're screaming both of those, they forget that the largest superfund site in the US is, in fact, a nuclear site in the US--Hanford, Washington will take a TRILLION dollars to clean up--all paid for by tax payers, all of it the result of LEARNING how to make this nuclear thing happen in a clean way.   \n\n\nBut the cost--it will take 10-15 years to build the plant, and another 25-30 before it turns a SINGLE PENNY of profit, so 40-45 years.   \n\n\nDo you know any billionaires that invest (and it has to be billionaires), who wont see a single penny of profit on their investment in their lifetime? No. No one does. That's why no one's doing Nuclear. That's why the government doesn't do it either, they would have a hell of a time trying to tell people that, for the next 50 years you have to pay high taxes and high electric prices so that they could get a Nuclear power plant online, so that in 50 years they could MAYBE reduce the electric rates to be cheaper (spoiler, they're not cheaper--they've got to plan and pay for and maintain the storage of their waste for the next million years).   \n\n\nThis is before we get to the problem that NO ONE has agreed to, or found a way to store or dispose the waste these monsters create. This isnt simply 'toxic' waste, like Coal plants, that you can sort of get around or clean up after a few decades. This is the sort of waste that will render hundreds of square miles at a time totally uninhabitable for humans for a thousand generations.   \n\n\nand that's assuming EVERYTHING WORKS AS INTENDED.   \n\n\nWhen it's vastly cheaper, and vastly more profitable to use wind or solar, why would you ever even consider nuclear?  \n\n\nIt's not unreasonable to look at this like buying cars. Nuclear is a nice ass fucking 1959 Chevy impala convertible. Chrome, goddamned beautiful, rides like a dream, has everything you want--AC, electric seats, heated mirrors, gorgeous paint--it's 55k. Every time it drips, you stop EVERYTHING and fix it, no matter the cost, or you cant drive it to shows or use it. OR--you could just buy a toyota corolla (solar/wind), it's cheap, it works, it costs less in gas (so you dont have to pick up a second job to afford to drive it to the first), and you dont have to worry if it gets a few dings and dents, or has a few spills.   \n\n\nSure, the corolla's not getting handed to your grandson, like the Impala, but the Corolla saved you so much money, and kept the air so much cleaner, that your grandson can have a fucking ferrari anyway.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630872987.0, "parent_id": "t3_pido2h", "replies": []}, {"author": "NoSuchKotH", "id": "hbouk24", "score": 5, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #91", "submission": "pido2h", "stickied": false, "body": "Because nuclear has become the new bogeyman.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630852017.0, "parent_id": "t3_pido2h", "replies": []}, {"author": "Weak_Astronomer2107", "id": "hbpfkqm", "score": 3, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #569", "submission": "pido2h", "stickied": false, "body": "People are afraid of it.
