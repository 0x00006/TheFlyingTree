So, when a man is looking for or fantasizing about women within his own age bracket, maybe we should just move along.\n\nAnd, just to leave things on a lighter note ...\n\n[Tom Lehrer -- Oedipus Rex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mScdJURKGWM)", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629008908.0, "parent_id": "t3_p4lx8n", "replies": []}, {"author": "Natural-Sun-8613", "id": "h902mtt", "score": 3, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "", "submission": "p4lx8n", "stickied": false, "body": "A woman that shows stability for a man that is less mature.
