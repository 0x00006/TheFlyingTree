{"title": "Discussion: Are Geniuses born or made? Why are people put off at the idea of becoming one?", "name": "t3_pc4xfv", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/pc4xfv/discussion_are_geniuses_born_or_made_why_are/", "selftext": "The definition of a genius    is:\n\n\"exceptional     intellectual or creative power or other     **natural ability**. \"\n\n\"an exceptionally intelligent person     or one with exceptional **skill** in a particular area of activity.\"\n\n\"extraordinary     intellectual power especially as manifested in creative activity\"\n\n\"Genius is an **exceptional talent or     skill**  \" <- This last definition wasnt even an official definition at all,  it was     just a description but is somehow way better than the 3 above,  why? Because this one covers both sides, talent and skill, talent is    natural, skill is worked for, one could also say that 'talent is hard     work unseen\" but for this case we can agree that     skill covers this  aspect.\n\n**Reposting     this question onto this subreddit     because a bot believes that I will find 'likeminded' individuals, I am in no     way asking this to seem like some philisophical twat nor am I asking this particular subreddit because I think that the people here are the     same, \"intelligent\" or identify as 'geniuses', I'm only asking here because my other 'highly intellectual' subreddit, that I too was chosen by a bot doesnt     have many people and most are offline, I would     assume they would be doing more important things,     but I have this cult instead so its all good :D, so feel free to humour me with this discussion topic.**\n\nPersonally I believe that it is **both**    natural geniuses are completely blown out of proportion, in most cases they are completely     exposed by the media making geniuses appear to  be 'natural' and 'gifted' putting these kids/young adults on shows and     whatnot to show off their abilities and achievements     and that may put  off anyone who one day would like to be known as one for mastering their  craft, the     common idea is that you cant become one    and that you are  just born lucky, I believe this to contribute to the     lack of progress in    the long run because everyone else is hoping that      some natural  genius(or just someone who is quite talented) would contribute to  humanity and push us   further.\n\nThe way   I see it, the main difference between a natural born genius and someone who has achieved the title/reputation as one is **time**.    Time is the most valuable and finite resource that we have, I believe this to be another main reason why    people are     put off at trying to excel at anything, they are already old,    the way the media represents  geniuses gives the idea that you need to      be a kid with a promising     future and lots of supportive people who     recognise your abilities, but  no, they are just the bright side of the coin,     the side that gets shown,  the side in the    dark(metaphorically   speaking) is where normal people  are, people who have the chance to become better but dont because they     havent achieved it earlier on.\n\nEdit: First paragraph\n\ntl;dr:  Natural born geniuses represented through the media give the idea that  all geniuses are natural and that normal people cant become them, so  people dont and end up living mediocre lives.", "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/pc4xfv/discussion_are_geniuses_born_or_made_why_are/", "id": "pc4xfv", "author": "Study_Tryhard", "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "num_comments": 22, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630000926.0, "comments": [{"author": "Kelyaan", "id": "hagrmku", "score": 3, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #271 | Consortii Concordus", "submission": "pc4xfv", "stickied": false, "body": "Nah I was an utter pleb of a child that could barely write, Now I'd say I'm a fucking genius in relation to the common English folk.
