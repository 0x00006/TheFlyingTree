A bot can be a simple maintenance script (for example, automatically delete old stuff more than X days old) or as complex as Google Assistant/Siri (tell it what you want and it uses complex artificial intelligence to automate everything from getting the info you need or launching another application or interacting with your smart home devices).\n\nCookies are quite simply session information stored on your machine. Typically, these hold info like a secure token representing your logged-in session (to stay logged in, it sends this to prove authentication instead of having to resubmit username and password again), but can really hold any information the dev wants to. You can always view a site's cookies to see the info too - I'm most familiar with Chrome so I'll use that example. Pull up any website you're logged into in Chrome. On the left side of the address bar, there's a little lock icon; click that and then click `Cookies (## in use)`.

That's a lot of time, effort and money you've sunk there! Assuming you use Google Chrome, it will save all your passwords except the Google account if you allow it to. When I forget a password, I just pull up passwords.google.com and look it up.\n\nWhen you configure your Google account, be sure to set up a recovery email and phone number and all that. Then, if you forget your password, you can still have a way to reset it. You sound like a chronic password forgetter, so may I advise working with a trusted family member and using their email as your recovery email - that way for you to truly lose access, they'd have to have lost access to theirs as well! My wife and I do that and our daughters' emails have mine set as their recovery email address. Actually, I think my father-in-law has mine set up as his as well lol!\n\nIf you're losing access and it's not because you've forgotten the passwords, you may have compromised devices - meaning you've clicked a bad link or downloaded a bad file and it's allowed someone the ability to steal your password... Or something as simple as using the same password for everything and that combination of username and password was involved in a data breach. Google actually has a tool on its passwords site to have all your passwords checked to see if it's out in the wild.\n\nVPNs are often sold without all the details of what they really are... It's short for Virtual Private Network, which sounds all fancy but really is just a network tunnel. When you're connected through a VPN, your internet traffic to the external world looks like it's coming from wherever the VPN itself is rather than your home. Your computer sends a request out - it goes straight to the VPN and is forwarded from there. When the service or site responds, it responds to the VPN and the VPN forwards the response back to you.\n\nThe most commonly used purpose for a VPN is for remote work. I am working from home during these COVID times, so in order to be able to access my work's protected internal network with all the computers, applications, services, etc., I connect to our VPN so all my requests are allowed around those protections, in a sense, giving me access to all these things I would otherwise be blocked from accessing by firewalls and such.\n\nBack to the point, configure your emails with backup recovery emails you can keep access to one way or another.\n\nSide note: for Apple accounts, can't really help you there..

Death doesn\u2019t just magically happen. For every death there is a mechanism behind it. I believe that at the end of the day even the mystery of aging is just yet another biological mechanism that can be discovered and disabled, perhaps even reversed. When you get hit by a car what kills you is the kinetic energy doing really nasty stuff to your internals. When you die of a disease like COVID it\u2019s because of the disease interfering with your body\u2019s(especially your lungs) ability to function. Behind every type of death, including from old age, there is a cause. Science has already dealt with many of these causes and is dealing with many more. Diseases and injuries that were at one point a death sentence are now minor inconveniences. Even the fabled influenza can beaten back with a little needle going into your arm. \n\nInstead of focusing on \u201cmy loved ones will die\u201d I focus on solutions to delaying the inevitable. Radical life extension to beat aging, synthetic organs to help with those with serious internal organ injuries and of course nano technology to obliterate cancer and basically everything else. Medical technology is moving at a breakneck pace now. We developed a COVID vaccine using a revolutionary new method in just one year and it actually works with minimal side effects. Everyone I care about has at least a solid 40 years on them and that\u2019s plenty of time to solve many of the issues they may face. I fully expect there to be an answer to Alzheimer\u2019s before my dad has to worry about it in a few decades for example. Aging is more complex but I still have most of my life ahead of me. I believe that before I die life extension will be realized or proper cryogenics will allow me to wait it out until it is.\n\nI don\u2019t focus on never seeing them again, I focus on how to ensure I can keep seeing them for as long as possible. In a way I guess you can say I\u2019m putting my \u201cfaith\u201d into the good scientists across the world doing revolutionary research into aging treatment and making synthetic organs, as well as those working on vaccines and treatments for all our worst diseases.
