I remember when then girlfriend and I found a baby rabbit in my parent's yard back when we were in high school. It was pretty lethargic at the time, so not sure if the mom abandoned it or the mom died. No clue how long it had been alone.\n\nWe looked online on how to take care of a baby rabbit, then sprinted to the pet store to buy some supplies. Wasn't expensive, but for a 17yo and 15yo, that was some money. Unfortunately, the rabbit didn't really want to drink any formula and died after a day or two. \n\nThough I think our rabbit was smaller and younger than yours.\n\nGood luck, hopefully your little guy makes it!", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628449716.0, "parent_id": "t3_p0k1si", "replies": []}, {"author": "luckyindigo12", "id": "h874jmx", "score": 4, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #155", "submission": "p0k1si", "stickied": false, "body": "Poor little guy.
