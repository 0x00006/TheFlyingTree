Yes american government overreacted to 9/11. And it broke the world.\n\n>it hasn't impacted our taxes negatively\n\n\nIn year 2000 the US spent 320 billion (3.1% GDP) on military. In 2002 it was 378 billion (3.4%), and it kept rising peaking in 2010 at nice even 738 billion (4.9%). US tax structure is highly confusing and non uniform so it may be so that the taxes weren't raised to fund that bs, but if they weren't - the money had to come from somewhere. So the cost to society came in slower development of healthcare and education. Coolio.\n\nBut not only that. Lives of thousands of immigrants have been made significantly worse due to raise in racism and racially motivated crime. And conversly an unprecedentet raise of nationalism which has its own problems. \n\nBut say you are a white guy with enough money for private schools and healthcare. Good for you, and maybe you think 9/11 did not impact you. Well then just go to the airport and spend 3 hours on security checks - which only became a thing after 9/11. Before you could get on a plane as easily as on a train. And you could have fluids with you and scissors and whatever you wanted. And be there 15 minutes earlier.\n\nThat reminds me, with the taxes - you do realise that TSA was created as a direct consequence of 9/11? It was a part of the official government response. Cool right? TSA's annual budget is around 7 billion$. So add that to increase in military spending. But wait actually the whole Department of Homeland Security was created as a response to 9/11 (again official communications) - 51 billion of annual budget.\n\nSo in summary your claim is that none of the tax increases in the past 21 years have been caused by ~380 billion increase in spending which can be attributed to 9/11? And that TSA, ICE and other agencies of Homeland Security have little impact on everyday Americans? I'm sorry mate, are you crazy?\n\nAnd that's only considering the US, 9/11 impacted in different ways Europe as well.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629663815.0, "parent_id": "t1_h9xnhca", "replies": [{"author": "entropyStable", "id": "h9z2ih5", "score": -1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #205", "submission": "p9cuca", "stickied": false, "body": "You need to posit what impact 9/11 had on America/the world such that it led to the decline of the US/the world.

So the cost to society came in slower development of healthcare and education. Coolio.\n\nYes money is fungible but you are incorrect in assuming the money has to come from somewhere else. The US doesn't run neutral budgets and just because it will deficit spend for one program doesn't mean it will do so for another. I agree the wars have been expensive but the average American hasn't felt the economic impact. The idea that the GOP would approver large scale deficit spending for health care and education, is absurd based on their current and historical stance on those issues. You are also missing a key piece of the argument, even if what you said is correct how would a slower increase in health and education spending lead to a declining of society. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>But not only that. Lives of thousands of immigrants have been made significantly worse due to raise in racism and racially motivated crime.\n\nYes it created increased xenophobia against Muslims and that is terrible but again you need to link this to some continuous decline of society. While you did see a spike after 9/11 the xenophobia seemed to drop until more recently when it has risen but also expanded to other groups. You are going to have a hard time crafting a narrative that links that back to 9/11 and some snowball effect after that. I posit the current trend in xenophobia is largely a result of the  2008 crash combined with an increasing push towards a service economy leading to economic hardship to traditionally stable classes but there are other theories for this trend. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>maybe you think 9/11 did not impact you. Well then just go to the airport and spend 3 hours on security checks - which only became a thing after 9/11. Before you could get on a plane as easily as on a train.

The statement I made is \"While it has cost money it hasn't impacted our taxes or inflation negatively so it is hard to argue the finical impact has caused this downward trend\". I never once said it didn't cause spending, to the contrary I said it did cost money but that the average American hasn't felt the ecominc impact.\n\nWe've run massive deficits to pay for the wars and so taxes haven't really changed since 2001 (you can say they have risen or fallen a small amount depending on how you compute the metric). But the important question is where are Americans feeling the impact of this spending? and how has it caused society to decline for 20 years? I'll give you a hint, you are going to need to show that this impact was comparable to the 2008 crash else that crash and hardship both on American house-holds and the US budget would be a more proximal cause to the decline.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>And that TSA, ICE and other agencies of Homeland Security have little impact on everyday Americans? \n\nTSA has very little impact, it is absurd to argue otherwise. Most Americans (by this I mean people living here not just citizens) haven't had meaningful interactions with ICE of HS. Wether or on not these departments should exist or if they are over zealous are separate questions.
