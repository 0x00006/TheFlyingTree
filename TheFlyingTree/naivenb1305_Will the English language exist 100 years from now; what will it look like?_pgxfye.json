It's been around in various forms, some more recognizable than others, for 1500 years.  Native speakers now number close to half a billion worldwide.  So I have to ask ... what are you expecting to have happen to all those people in the next few decades?  >\\_>\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**what will it look like?**\n\nAha, that is a somewhat different question.  One of the delightful things about language is that it's impossible to predict with certainty what it's going to do next.  We can see current trends and extrapolate them but there's nothing that says that the trends have to continue -- something may disrupt them and a new, different trend may emerge.\n\nNonetheless, prediction is fun.  I will predict something:  over the next 100 years, a form of formal, or international, or \"high\" English is going to emerge as separate from more colloquial forms spoken natively in different parts of the Anglophonic world.\n\nWe already see some signs of this happening.  For one thing, it's an old story in Great Britain, so it's not like this is even a new concept.  For another, we already have a distinct vocabulary people use when trying to speak formally.  They will replace certain words, like saying \"state\" instead of \"say,\" or \"individual\" instead of \"person.\"  Another example is that as people get used to speaking English online with other English speakers all over the world, they seem to instinctively learn to strip out colloquialisms that would not make sense to their audience.\n\nA linguist would probably say that right now, today, those are probably more just modes of speech, or codes or something.  But they could in the next 100 years become more divergent and formalized into different dialects.  Pronoun shifts might be part of that too.  There might be a standard form of English in which you refer to everyone in the 3rd person as \"they.\"  But when you are with your buds from your neighborhood, you revert to gendered language.  Or something like that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**will it be as useful in 2121?**\n\nSo, the crazy thing about English in 2021 is that more people on Earth speak it as fluent non-natives (600m) than native speakers (400m), and even more than that speak it subfluently (>1bn).  Contrast that with French, an incredibly popular foreign-language choice around the world:  subfluent speakers of French are still only about \u00bc of the population of fluent speakers.\n\nThe reason I point that out is that not long ago, it was French that was as close as it came at the time to being *the* international language.  French is still spoken natively or fluently by almost a quarter billion people around the world, but it doesn't have that same \"penumbra\" of secondary speakers anymore.\n\nWhat changed?\n\nI read somewhere that the Treaty of Versailles marked the end of French primacy as the world's international language -- it was the first time in the modern era that a treaty had been formally written in another language (English) alongside French.  I don't know if that's actually true, but if so, it suggests that French cultural authority might have been one of the many battlefield casualties of the First World War.\n\nSo I guess maybe the question to ask is:  what could happen in the next 100 years that would be comparable, that would render English less influential, or would lessen Anglophonic cultural authority?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**Will English be supplemented by another language, such as Chinese or Hindu**\n\nAssuming you mean \"supplanted,\" \"Mandarin,\" and \"Hindi,\" it seems clear that the real question is why people all over the world would find that they suddenly (because 100 years is pretty sudden for these things) need to learn one of those other languages to function as part of the world, instead of English.\n\nToday, English is influential because native English-speaking nations do a lot of business around the world, they are online in large numbers, and their countries are appealing places to go to study, work, and even live.\n\nBy contrast, Hindi is very useful if you already live in a Hindi-speaking part of India, and Mandarin is very useful if you already live in the right part of China, but if you don't already live in those places, the utility drops off rather steeply.  People around the world aren't vying to study computer systems or engineering at rural universities in China's interior.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**will it split into different languages, much as after the fall of Rome?**\n\nThis will not happen, for the simple reason that widespread literacy and the wide dispersion of printed writing has made modern languages much more stable.  And that doesn't even take into account the impact of ubiquitous global electronic communication.  We just aren't going to see the kind of demographic isolation that led to the linguistic fragmentation of the Latin-speaking world.\n\nAnd certainly not in 100 years -- not even back then did languages change that much in that short of a time.  Rather, as I understand it, the regional differences were already there, and had been widening all along.  If we notice them suddenly after the fall of Rome, it's only because Latin literacy and the printed output of the \"ruling language\" plummeted.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630663016.0, "parent_id": "t3_pgxfye", "replies": [{"author": "naivenb1305", "id": "hbfteu6", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #561", "submission": "pgxfye", "stickied": false, "body": "(1) I agree\n\n(2) I agree.

There will undoubtedly be some idioms and phrases that would be unfamiliar, but probably not a lot.\n\nIf there is a tech singularity, it depends a lot on how frame shifted we are and how ubiquitous that is.  Frame shifting is our relative perception of time.  If, for instance, I download my brain pattern to a computer that can operate 100 times the speed of my neurons, then 100 real world years becomes 10000 years worth of experiences.  10000 years is roughly the same timeframe as human civilization.  If that computer can operate at 10000x the speed of my neurons, then 100 years becomes a million years of subjective time, which is longer than humans have been humans.  With that said, you can always slow down your frame, and at least initially it seems doubtful that everybody would elect to be digital.  For many people and communities, it seems likely that they would elect to remain on a relatively human normal frame most of the time, at least until the majority of humankind abandons organic meatsuits.  Which, given that the meatsuits with their original consciousness will probably still persist after we download our consciousnesses, seems unlikely to be very quick.\n\nAlthough some of that depends on how competitive future humans are.  Clearly faster frames offer competitive advantages, thus it seems likely that some individuals or communities would run their clocks as fast as possible.  Of course, since a digital copy of our consciousness isn't actually us but a separate entity, competitive humans would run the risk of having their digital copies diverge to the point where they no longer have the same goals.  If they're overclocked and competitive, then it seems likely to spawn an entirely different culture with entirely different goals in a likely very small amount of human normal time.\n\nIn any case, the more subjective time passes, the further the language will diverge as the culture evolves to include new concepts, stories, and themes.  A subjective 100 years isn't enough to change language significantly, but the more zeros you add to that number of subjective time the greater that divergence will be.
