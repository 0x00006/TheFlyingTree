This may be difficult if conditions that need to be questioned need to be questioned because you cannot accumulate resources.\n\nA failure to do so would leave you at the starting point, and without the resources to question authority, you\u2019d have no \u201cmoral\u201d ground to do so.\n\nBy working harder to accumulate resources, and challenging authority to remove cognitive dissonance, you\u2019d be back at square one.\n\nSo, power perpetuates itself.\n\nI\u2019m either crazy or on to something.

To begin with: the moral obligation to question authority is present only in democratic society. In a totalitarian one for example one does not have such an obligation, as it would get them killed. So we need to consider democracies only.\n\nNow since this moral obligation is essentially one of the guards which make a democracy a functioning system it's also logical to consider it a tool to maintain the democracy. As such it is already a tool of maintaining the status quo. Now let's sprinkle on top of that the real world stuff you mentioned: the economic necessity of posessing resources in order to effectively question authority.\n\nOne can notice that the amount of resources necessary to effectively question authority is inversly proportional to the diversity of the political scene in a given state. In other words it's easier to have your words heard in a more pluralistic system and harder in say a two party system.\n\nIn democracies designed to become two party systems by their administrative procedures (so in countries such as the US, UK or Poland) the moral obligation of questioning the authority becomes but a tool for legitimising the governance, while effectively maintaining status quo. There is very little an individual can do in such systems to act out any kind of change, thus making questioning the authority nothing but a mirage, an afterimage of a dream, which a well functioning democracy would be.\n\nIn other words the less pluralistic a democratic system is the more it resembles in its actual functioning a more power-centralised system, in which the moral obligation does not exist. The moral obligation to question authority is not a thing in feudalism, totalitarianism or in technocracy.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630398810.0, "parent_id": "t3_peppz9", "replies": [{"author": "Least_Land", "id": "hb3byx5", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #226", "submission": "peppz9", "stickied": false, "body": "Thank you for the thoughtful comment.
