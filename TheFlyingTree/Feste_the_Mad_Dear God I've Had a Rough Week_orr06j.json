I abruptly became way more busy than I'm used to, routines had to change suddenly, there was something else that I don't feel comfortable sharing. It's been exhausting. \n\nThat being said, it has ended. I finally registered for university courses on Saturday, which was a massive relief. I finally got my Dad to show me how to shave, whicg was, again, very relieving for my non-binary self.", "score": 13, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/orr06j/dear_god_ive_had_a_rough_week/", "id": "orr06j", "author": "Feste_the_Mad", "link_flair_text": "Event", "num_comments": 13, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1627272125.0, "comments": [{"author": "MisanthropicScott", "id": "h6k7e2h", "score": 3, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Druid #6 | Ordo Cognitus", "submission": "orr06j", "stickied": false, "body": "Sorry you've had a rough time of it.

In fact, after being advised by my fitness watch that I should be taking a break, I've even decided that this is the week I try CBD, because proper sleep may not be possible in the near term.\n\nTL;DR you're not alone. Happy Monday.\n\nPS on shaving: I'm not sure what kind of razor you learned to shave with, but if it was the sort that uses a disposable blade cartridge, you owe it to yourself (and can pay one back to your father) to try out a safety razor. They're much less expensive in the long run and I think they give a much closer and cleaner shave.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1627283958.0, "parent_id": "t3_orr06j", "replies": [{"author": "0s_and_1s", "id": "h6keueg", "score": 3, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "", "submission": "orr06j", "stickied": false, "body": "Jesus Christ, I thought I was having a shit week.
