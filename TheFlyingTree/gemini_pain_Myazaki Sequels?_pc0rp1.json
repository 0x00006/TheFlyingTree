Would you want one? I am mildly surprised that as big as his movies are, I\u2019ve not seen any attempts to expand on any of the worlds he has created. I\u2019m not saying I necessarily want any sequels to my favorite movies, but does nobody want to know what happened to the war in Howls moving castle? Has anything changed in the boathouse after Haku (the bosses personal assistant and technically very important person that maintains the bathhouse!?) left\u2026or maybe didn\u2019t leave? Maybe more stories with Kiki and her delivery service? (Honestly as much as I love it the end was a bit weak, and could make for a cliffhanger into a series) I don\u2019t want to debate whether they would be good or not, just would people want to see them/be receptive to the idea and what specific movies would have interesting sequel ideas?", "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/pc0rp1/myazaki_sequels/", "id": "pc0rp1", "author": "gemini_pain", "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "num_comments": 16, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629988515.0, "comments": [{"author": "shig23", "id": "hafil4n", "score": 4, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Druid #5", "submission": "pc0rp1", "stickied": false, "body": "Well, *Howl\u2019s Moving Castle* did have a sequel, but it was called *Castle in the Air.* They would have to change the title to avoid confusion with another Miyazaki picture. \n\nThey did make a [*Kiki* sequel](https://youtu.be/zFrzSLa7YRs), but only to shill for noodles. \n\nAs for the rest\u2026 does anyone really want to see *Spirited Back* or *My Neighbor Totoro Won\u2019t Move His Damn Garbage Cans?*\n\nEdit: They actually did do a Totoro sequel, *Mei and the Kittenbus,* but you have to go to the Ghibli Museum in Mitaka to see it.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629989468.0, "parent_id": "t3_pc0rp1", "replies": [{"author": "gemini_pain", "id": "hafomb4", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #43", "submission": "pc0rp1", "stickied": false, "body": "Hey!
