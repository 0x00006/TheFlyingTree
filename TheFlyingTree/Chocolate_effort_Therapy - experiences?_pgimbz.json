Especially for people who have never been and don\u2019t know what the red flags are. I really couldn\u2019t say what the ratio of bad to good therapists are, but there seem to be a lot more stories like yours than we would like. \n\nThe unfortunate truth is, there are two kinds of people who look for those in need. Those who wish to exploit vulnerability and those who wish to help. The number one difference between the two is that one wants to empower the individual and one wants to control. \n\nIt\u2019s also possible that among the many therapeutic schools of thought, one particular therapist may lean very heavily into an approach that may not be suitable to you. Therapists are taught to be flexible and tailor their approach to the individual, but whether it\u2019s a lack of skill or will, they end up becoming too one-dimensional. \n\nIt\u2019s really too bad that the process is so chock full of challenges for those who may not be able to afford a bad experience. Especially when the need is so great and the difference therapy can make is life changing. \n\nI think one solution is for society (we can all help with this) to continue to break down the stigma against therapy and mental illness in general. The more comfortable people are talking about their experience, the easier it will be for people to know what to expect and even find recommendations to therapists that other people have had a good experience with.

For two reasons: a) to get a firsthand taste of what therapy is and how it works and b) to know themselves well enough so they are grounded/ aware of transference/ cross-transference when it occurs. I think it's a great idea. \n\nI work in healthcare and the latter I recognized even before I knew there was a term for it. I found that certain patients made me feel frustrated/ annoyed or they themselves were frustrated/ angered by me. I learned that sometimes it wasn't them that made me feel that way but rather they reminded me of people/ situations I had been in before that evoked those feelings. It made me take things much less personally and help me clearly see their problems in order to help them. I am not a psychiatrist/ psychologist but an internist so I imagine the experience is even more intense for my colleagues as they are outright dealing with psychological issues. Interestingly, I've had angry patients apologize to me weeks later. Usually, they also recognize they were overwhelmed by the situation and they took it out on me but that I wasn't really the source of their feelings. Not every angry patient but I would say a good 50%. \n\nI have book about the process of therapy on my to read list called \"[Maybe You Should Talk To Someone](https://smile.amazon.com/Maybe-You-Should-Talk-Someone/dp/1328662055?sa-no-redirect=1).\" You and others might find it interesting.\n\nBTW, I agree that finding a good therapist is important and if possible, everyone should interview a few before deciding on one. Sometimes it's not only about how well-educated, trained, or experienced someone is, it's also about how well they jibe with you. I know there are some patients whom I don't \"click\" with emotionally and vice-versa although on a technical level, things work just fine. Then there are some where we just immediately get each other and it's not necessarily because they're the same sex, similar age, or even come from the same ethnic/ educational/ geographic, etc. background as me.
