Here are a few reasons why.\n\nI've been an environmentalist for over 40 years. I haven't minded being treated as a kooky tree-hugger, but it is disheartening to see that, no matter how often the science and predictions are proven right, the general population has never given a shit. Believe me when I say that I find no joy in being proven right about impending environmental catastrophes. Now, the best we can hope for is to mitigate the extinction level event we as a world population have brought upon ourselves.\n\nIn the constitutional United States of America where I live, democracy is collapsing, and realistically within 5 or 10 more years we won't have a government elected by the people. This is not some old man rant about how things were better in the good old days. By any reasonable measure, tyranny is overtaking the US. If you haven't yet read *On Tyranny* by Timothy Snyder I urge you to do so soon.  \n\nCovid-19. The death cult that is the backbone of those that worship at the feet of Trump have ensured that the worst of the pandemic has come well after vaccines are available to all who want them in the US. It would be hard to understand why this is, except that it fits an all too familiar pattern that if Democrats are in favor of something - no matter what that something is - Republicans ***must*** be opposed to it. The sickness is so rampant that the death cult cheerfully takes horse dewormer for COVID, but shuns vaccines, for no other reason than it is the opposite of what scientists recommend.\n\nI will have hope for humanity up to and including my last breath. And I want the younger folks out there to know that some of us will never stop fighting for your future. I see many of you energized and working to fix problems created by or simply ignored by the previous generations (many of whom complain about \"today's youth\"!!!).\n\nStay strong. And if it is at all possible, hang on to whatever optimism you have. You are going to need it.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630944730.0, "parent_id": "t3_pj0xnu", "replies": [{"author": "NoSuchKotH", "id": "hbunrc8", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #91", "submission": "pj0xnu", "stickied": false, "body": ">I've been an environmentalist for over 40 years.

Back in the 80s, in Europe, people were very much aware of their environmental impact. There were large protests almost every month as acid rain and forest decline were not only an imminent problem, but also clearly visible.\n\nUnfortunately, by the end of the 90s / early 2000s, most of the scars in the forests were gone and people started to forget. Today climate change is much less visible and one has to compare long term, which is very hard for most people, even if it's clearly visible (e.g. when I was young in December everything was snow covered. Today we are lucky if we have a bit of snow in February).\n\nI wont comment on the train wreck that the US is, as there are people better suited for that.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630961053.0, "parent_id": "t1_hbtmiqa", "replies": [{"author": "Walking_the_Cascades", "id": "hbv0epu", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #68", "submission": "pj0xnu", "stickied": false, "body": ">Back in the 80s, in Europe, people were very much aware of their environmental impact.

There were and still are many, many people that are environmentally aware. Europeans often lead the way. And there are a lot of \"wins\" for both the environment and humanity in general.\n\nI was trying to make clear than the overall global population doesn't give a damn about the environment, at least until it affects them personally. But there are also an awful lot of people that are too busy trying to feed their families, scratch out a living, or just stay alive for another day - and for them any problems future generations may face are secondary to their immediate survival. \n\nI don't have all the answers. But it is clear that as a world population we are making the planet we live on more and more uninhabitable. We need to think clearly and work together, but that does not seem to be in our nature.

You can't do social reforms, or any reforms for that matter, if you are on an empty stomach. Living in a war zone? Forget doing anything but keeping your head down!\n\nThat's why, IMHO, the industrial nations have to lead the way in environmental reforms. It might be inconvenient. It might even hurt us. But it is necessary. And more often than not, it will have global effects. E.g. the RoHS directive of the EU, which was considered a bad move by the electronics industry in Europe, as it would surely lead to much higher cost for products specifically built for Europe. In the end it turned out that basically the whole world de facto switched to RoHS because it was easier than running separate production lines for Europe.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630968055.0, "parent_id": "t1_hbv0epu", "replies": [{"author": "Walking_the_Cascades", "id": "hbv4pkw", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #68", "submission": "pj0xnu", "stickied": false, "body": "Spot on.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630968961.0, "parent_id": "t1_hbv2uyz", "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"author": "developedby", "id": "hbucobe", "score": 4, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #71 | Consortii Concordus", "submission": "pj0xnu", "stickied": false, "body": "I expect them to have a hard life and hate their ancestors", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630956111.0, "parent_id": "t3_pj0xnu", "replies": []}, {"author": "MysticTheMeeM", "id": "hbtuk7z", "score": 4, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Druid #16", "submission": "pj0xnu", "stickied": false, "body": "We're all fucked, but they're more fucked.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630948212.0, "parent_id": "t3_pj0xnu", "replies": [{"author": "TOTT3NH4M", "id": "hbwekjj", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #559", "submission": "pj0xnu", "stickied": false, "body": "The greatest generations are made in the most difficult times", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630993531.0, "parent_id": "t1_hbtuk7z", "replies": []}]}, {"author": "TrickyLemons", "id": "hbv14zl", "score": 3, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #85", "submission": "pj0xnu", "stickied": false, "body": "I\u2019m gen Z myself.
