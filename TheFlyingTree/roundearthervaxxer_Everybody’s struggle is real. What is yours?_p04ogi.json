This hurts the most because they save up about 20 years before buying and preparing for retail business but then found out about cancer, kidney disease so everything was put to a halt.

The money was good, the work was steady, but everything about that place was toxic. It was like walking around in Chernobyl:  I couldn't see any physical damage but I was always aware that the 'radiation' was killing me. Towards the end I was having anxiety and panic attacks just trying to get to work. I'd have them in the middle of the shift and it was so fucking humiliating.\n\nMy condition just got worse and worse until finally I couldn't take it anymore. I stopped coming into work, then eventually called to tell them I wasn't able to do it anymore.\n\nIn trying to understand what was wrong with me, I found out I  was autistic and had ADHD. Once I knew that pretty much EVERYTHING started making a lot more sense.\n\nJust because it makes sense though doesn't mean the struggle's over. See I was wearing a mask for pretty much my whole life, but that mask didn't fit me, and I'd never wanted it in the first place. It was forced upon me by my parents, by my peers and teachers and the other adults in my life. They shaped it, they forced me to wear the mask 24/7.\n\nNow it's gone and I don't know how to make a new one. I can't even pretend like I want to go back into the workforce anymore. Even staring down the barrel of homelessness and starvation I still just can't do it. I don't want to be a productive member of a society that has never wanted the real, authentic me, and never will. I'd rather wander off into the wilds and try to die peacefully on my own terms than keep living by everyone else's. \n\nThere's no logic to that feeling, and I'm still trying to find some way to make a living that won't leave me feeling crushed, broken, and hopeless, but it's a half-hearted, insincere effort. I don't want to wear the mask anymore. I don't want to lie and be dishonest just to get by. I don't want to sell my time just for the privilege of existing.\n\nThat's all there is in this life, though.
