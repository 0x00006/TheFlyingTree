Sometimes there are grafitti artworks from top tier sprayers which look beatiful, but even I can't figure out some of the letters. You need to develop an understanding for typography, I think thatvis the key. Otherwise I don't really have advice for you on that, other than that sprayers like to distort letters... ;)", "is_submitter": true, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630267942.0, "parent_id": "t1_hauawst", "replies": []}]}]}
