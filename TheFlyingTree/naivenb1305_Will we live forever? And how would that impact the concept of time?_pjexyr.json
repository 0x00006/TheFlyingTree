Adopting a combined deterministic and stochastic model we conclude from a statistical point of view that **the probability that our civilisation survives itself is less than 10% in the most optimistic scenario.** Calculations show that, maintaining the actual rate of population growth and resource consumption, in particular forest consumption, **we have a few decades left before an irreversible collapse of our civilisation** (see Fig. 5). Making the situation even worse, we stress once again that **it is unrealistic to think that the decline of the population in a situation of strong environmental degradation would be a non-chaotic and well-ordered decline.** This consideration leads to an even shorter remaining time. Admittedly, in our analysis, we assume parameters such as population growth and deforestation rate in our model as constant. This is a rough approximation which allows us to predict future scenarios based on current conditions. Nonetheless **the resulting mean-times for a catastrophic outcome to occur, which are of the order of 2\u20134 decades** (see Fig. 5), make this approximation acceptable, as it is hard to imagine, in absence of very strong collective efforts, big changes of these parameters to occur in such time scale.'\n\n---\n\n> And how would that impact the concept of time?\n\nThis is a very interesting hypothetical question.\n\nEven if humans could live *only* a million years, it would affect our willingness to take risks. A human with a life expectancy of a million years would never drive a car or cross a street. The cumulative risk of such high risk activities over that time frame would be unacceptable.\n\n---\n\n> Life expectances have increased, yet technology has grown, too. Will humans be able to live forever/ If so, what forms will that take, how will it impact our perception of time, and will we even fit our current understanding of what it means to be alive?\n\nI think you need to define forever in this. Clearly, we'd need to get off this planet before the sun engulfs it. But, right now we have much more immediate environmental issues that we are completely and utterly failing to address.\n\nIf we want to live \"forever\" (in quotes because we don't live in an eternal universe), we absolutely cannot continue to [steal from the future to feed ourselves in the present.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Overshoot_Day) And, we probably need to stop making any new humans.\n\nLastly, would you really want to live forever? Or, do you just mean a long time?", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630990396.0, "parent_id": "t3_pjexyr", "replies": []}, {"author": "ETL6000yotru", "id": "hbwjyfi", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #138", "submission": "pjexyr", "stickied": false, "body": "I would love to live long enough to meet aliens or friendly sentient ai", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630997502.0, "parent_id": "t3_pjexyr", "replies": []}, {"author": "kinokomushroom", "id": "hbwqwpx", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #409", "submission": "pjexyr", "stickied": false, "body": "I'm worried our brains aren't designed to work properly forever.
