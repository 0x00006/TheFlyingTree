Fahrenheit, Celsius? Let us us Celsius as this is the most common degrees of temperature used on this planet. So, that is give or take 10^(12) Kelvin. \n\nLet us also assume that it is a black body radiation. \n\nUsing Wien's displacement law we try to find out with what kind of radiation we are dealing with. From this we get the peak of the radiation which is at 58.8 ZHz. That's zezta-Hertz. 58.8 \u00b7 10^(21) Hz . A photon at that wavelength has an energy of 243 MeV. That is easier to handle and understand. \n\nIn other words you get blasted with a very broad spectrum. Inferred? Yes. Ultraviolet? Yes UVA, UVB, UVC. Yes, yes, yes., Even Extreme Ultraviolet lights? Yes. X-rays and gamma rays? Yes. Beyond what is possible from radioactive decay? Yes. More than we can achieve in accelerators? No. But still far more than enough energy to knock out neutrons from the nuclei of your atoms and making them instable. You actually become radioactive.\n\nAccordingly, the heat transfer might be the least you have to worry about. But let us see if this is true.\n\nFor the heat transfer we would have to know what you mean by \"earth\". Is it just the actual earth, the rocky ball we stand on, or is it also the air around us and maybe even the buildings?  Let us assume it is just the actual earth it self.\n\nUsing Stefan\u2013Boltzmann law we find that each square meter (which is approximately 10 square feet) of the earth will radiate an energy of 28 \u00b7 10^(30) GJ during this half second. Is this a lot? Oh yes it is a lot! It is around 4 times the total mass energy of the moon. All the mass of the moon converted into pure energy and blasted out as \"heat\" radiation. Four times. Per square meter! Holly guacamole.\n\nHow much of that energy could go potentially into your body (\"luckely\" some will get right through you) and heat you up? Around that much, give or take, considering you have a surface area of around 1.6 m^(2), you are standing on the open field, you reflect some light (albedo), and the earth might not be a perfect black body radiator. \n\nFrom here we could calculate how much energy enters your body but does not go through it. We could use for that the part of the spectrum down to a wavelength from 10 nm (Extreme UV) which is still hell of a lot.  I leave this as an exercise.\n\nThen we could also look at a narrow band of just the visible light or infrared ligth and look at its effect on the skin as this does not penetrate that deep in to the skin, and thus most of the energy is deposited there. \n\nLet us use 5000 nm , Mid-IR. This is where fabrics are relatively poor in blocking IR light. Let us consider a very narrow band of light of just 1 nm. From this very narrow band alone you will be blasted with around 40 kJ of energy per mm^(2). That is enough energy to evaporate 17 grams of water into steam. It is a bit more than a table spoon full. Not much you say?  Hmm, it is also 40 GJ on surface of 1m^(2), which is enough to evaporate 17 tons of water! \n\nLooks like the classic heat radiation alone is more than enough to blast you into pieces plus the intense gamma radiation which literally destroys your atoms as well.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629986437.0, "parent_id": "t3_pbuqqs", "replies": []}, {"author": "gr13fy", "id": "hafdews", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #223", "submission": "pbuqqs", "stickied": false, "body": "hurty", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629987322.0, "parent_id": "t3_pbuqqs", "replies": []}, {"author": "Kelyaan", "id": "hafgwl1", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #271 | Consortii Concordus", "submission": "pbuqqs", "stickied": false, "body": "That's easy - Every living thing upon the planet is instantly glassed into oblivious, all gasses combust blowing away the atmosphere, All water explodes due to the head and is turned into super heated steam and potentially blows itself into hydrogen and oxygen which then combusts, All stone/dirt/sand would be glassed and melt into charred nonsense.  \n\n\n(This is more theoretical now)  \n\n\nNow since you said the Earth itself became one trillion degrees and not just hit with that heat - The entire planet for that half a second would be so hot that flash points are well gone and the entire planet would be so hot it liquifies, the core of the earth would then begin to slowly move the parts that have contained it and begin to mix - The gravity of the planet would then begin to fluctuate meaning out orbit begins to change, Now I have no idea how fast it would cool down but if it was slow enough the entire planet would break from orbit of the sun and we'd shoot off into the void of space which would cool us down faster into a chunk of black rock and we'd either be obliterated by asteroids as we now have a bigger gravitational well or we'll be picked up by another celestial body.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629988781.0, "parent_id": "t3_pbuqqs", "replies": []}, {"author": "bolrnly", "id": "hafr1cv", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #155 | Ordo Cognitus", "submission": "pbuqqs", "stickied": false, "body": "hot", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629992924.0, "parent_id": "t3_pbuqqs", "replies": []}, {"author": "Happy_INTP", "id": "hafuw4p", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #69", "submission": "pbuqqs", "stickied": false, "body": "Why is this food for thought?
