Obviously I've read that there are acolytes (those of us who are newly selected), seekers who have been around a while, and only 20 druids at the top. How does one work there way up to the position of druid if there is only 20 positions? Is there any incentive to becoming one? And if those druids do not allow themselves get culled then supposedly there is no hope of ever becoming one as there will never be more open positions, right? \n\nDo we get more privileges as we get further up the totem pole? I see there are 8 moderators as well. Makes me wonder whats beyond the position of druid? Surely there are other, higher positions? Someone had to create this place. Does anyone have any more information? This lowly acolyte wants to know more!", "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.63, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/pgrhtt/theflyingtree_heirarchy/", "id": "pgrhtt", "author": "PhilboBaggins111", "link_flair_text": "Question", "num_comments": 6, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630619424.0, "comments": [{"author": "MisanthropicScott", "id": "hbecdcb", "score": 4, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Druid #6 | Ordo Cognitus", "submission": "pgrhtt", "stickied": false, "body": "Only the moderators are exempt from the culling. Even druids get culled if we miss a week.\n\nYou move up by not getting culled and waiting like a vulture^* for others to get culled out from under you. It's all about time. The ranks are by who has been here the longest. At first you move quickly as there are a lot of people ahead of you and a high likely hood of multiple people in front of you being culled each week. The closer you get to being Druid #1, the less likely you are to move on any given week.\n\nThe only advantage to a lower number within a rank or a higher rank is that it looks cool. At least it looks cool if you think that having no life and living only on the internet is cool. Otherwise, you decide what you think of those of us who have posted here every single week for most of a year.\n\n\\* No offense to vultures. Vultures get a bad rap. If you're walking in the desert looking for water gasping for your last breath, vultures will give you that last chance. The lions on the horizon will not be so nice.
