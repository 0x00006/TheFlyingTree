What would you say is the take home of an average sex worker and say a top 10% sex worker and how does that compare across guys girls and orientations? \n3. Do you enjoy it and does it make things more difficult to enjoy in your private life?\n4. How many people would you say the average sex worker sleeps with in a working week and if it varies wildly what sort of ranges are we talking? \n5. Does getting it up become a challenge? I mean as teenager I could imagine keeping up with any number of partners but these days if I had 2 orgasms in a day, it would take a titanic effort to get things going again and I can't imagine you're that attracted to all your clients. If you use assistance like viagra is there any problems with doing it a lot?\n\nThanks in advance for taking the time!", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1626709085.0, "parent_id": "t1_h5r9jmj", "replies": [{"author": "I_Am_Anjelen", "id": "h5s0awy", "score": 3, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #297", "submission": "on38kp", "stickied": false, "body": "1) I am pansexual. Which I define personally as 'When I get to play in the crawlspace, I don't care about the plumbing'. Or less bluntly put, I consider myself to be gender-blind with regards to whether or not I am sexually attracted to people.\n\n2) There really isn't a simple answer for this. \n\nHere in the Netherlands, the 'going rate' for window workers is, to the best of my knowledge, 20-30 euros per 'trick' with greater charges for 'extras'. Which may include such things as 'fondling my breasts' and 'kissing'. I've known window workers who had sex with as many as 20 people in a day (though that's not by any means an average)\n\nThe average income for _self employed_ window workers I've known in my past seems to have been anywhere from 250 to 750 euros per day, disregarding expenses. That said, on the higher end of that, you're probably not doing that five days a week if you know what's good for you.\n\nThat said, I am mordicus against non-self-employed sex work. Pimps should've gone the way of the dodo ages ago. Sex clubs where you pay to use the commodities are an edge case depending on how much of your income is lost to, say, renting a room or play space and/or membership fees.\n\nAs a Pro-dom I am not a window worker. I visit, or receive, at home. Since I am mostly going to be engaging people within the framework of their specific fetishes and often _very_ specific fantasies, the onus is on me to fit within someone's view of what makes me a good Dom. Therefore my prices _start_ at 150 per hour, for which my client will get some mild pain-play, some bondage, and/or some humiliation, things on that level. For twice that per hour, I may include things like (safe) oral sex. My pants don't come off for anything less than 450 an hour, and having to wear special clothing, or engage in 'stranger' fetishes such as urolagnia (watersports) or (dirty) diaper-play, my prices go up accordingly and sometimes _startlingly_. On the other hand my prices may go _down_ depending on how much I like this particular client, how much their frame of needs fits my personal fetishes, and so on.\n\nMy prices are so high because I'll have far fewer (potential) clients per week. On the other hand I can suffice with having four or five sessions per week, especially if those sessions are on the more expensive side. The nature of my particular kind of sex work also lends itself more readily to repeat customers, so I can shedule my sessions accordingly. My record has been six four-hour sessions in a week, each averaging 500 per hour. However, I could barely _move_ that weekend and had to take it easy the next week.\n\nWithout meaning _any_ disrespect to window workers - (pro)Domming is just, simply put, more involved than fucking.\n\nOn average I tried to have 2500-4500 euros of income weekly.\n\n3)I wouldn't have done my job if I hadn't enjoyed it. Being fully polyamorous I never really differentiated clients from partners other than the fact that my clients paid me for the privilege of being my (temporary) partner. \n\n4)see #2 - with the caveat that sometimes, you just have an off day. or week.\n\n5)Want to know a trick? I don't _enjoy_ orgasms, or at least not when it comes to my gratification. My partners know and respect that I get much more personal and sexual gratification out of making them lose themselves to me than I get out of  'getting off'. I _prefer to_ however spend hours playing with and pushing my partner's buttons, getting them to subspace and beyond, nudging them into orgasms (or spoiling their orgasms) as required. Since I rarely _cum_, getting it up is never a problem. With my partners, who know me, my not cumming isn't an issue. With my _clients_ I can fake it. If I feel the need to, or I get paid not to fake it I can make myself cum pretty much on command, given that I've not done so for an hour or so beforehand. Considering the average play session I engage in lasts at least twice that long, there's really no issue.\n\nThat said, if I _must_ get off, I can get off given 3 minutes in a reasonably quiet room.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1626717160.0, "parent_id": "t1_h5rhe89", "replies": [{"author": "_DarthBob_", "id": "h5sa9jn", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "", "submission": "on38kp", "stickied": false, "body": "Thank you for a very interesting glance into another world!", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1626721412.0, "parent_id": "t1_h5s0awy", "replies": [{"author": "I_Am_Anjelen", "id": "h5sbb2l", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #297", "submission": "on38kp", "stickied": false, "body": "No worries, you can deposit your $5,- at\n\nI kid, I kid!", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1626721862.0, "parent_id": "t1_h5sa9jn", "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"author": "StopBanningMeGDIT", "id": "h5p5p58", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #254", "submission": "on38kp", "stickied": false, "body": "Medicaid Case Manager and stay at home dad at the same time", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1626655843.0, "parent_id": "t3_on38kp", "replies": [{"author": "areyouseriousdotard", "id": "h5q1eqq", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #109", "submission": "on38kp", "stickied": false, "body": "Straight medicaid or managed medicaid?", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1626674341.0, "parent_id": "t1_h5p5p58", "replies": [{"author": "StopBanningMeGDIT", "id": "h5qkv5k", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #254", "submission": "on38kp", "stickied": false, "body": "Managed, unfortunately.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1626691123.0, "parent_id": "t1_h5q1eqq", "replies": [{"author": "areyouseriousdotard", "id": "h5u5h29", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #109", "submission": "on38kp", "stickied": false, "body": "Which one?\nYou used the be the bane of my existence but I'm not a home health case manager anymore.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1626753657.0, "parent_id": "t1_h5qkv5k", "replies": [{"author": "StopBanningMeGDIT", "id": "h5yb5ie", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #254", "submission": "on38kp", "stickied": false, "body": "Aetna, probably one of the worst haha.
