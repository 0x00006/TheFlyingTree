I can see many ups and downs to eternal youth but when it comes down to it, it really means \"eternity\". Even though I don't fear eternity of life it could eventually get empty. But again, that's just my theory. It would probably be much different since everyone would be basically immortal as well. I think about the chaos it would cause and all the other people who might have bought eternal youth that would become murders, rapists, pedophiles, or just criminals in general. There is always a possibility that even the \"good\"(because there isn't really such thing as good and evil) might turn into that. There are so many possible outcomes for the future if eternal youth was found and all of those possibilities are insanely intriguing. I think one thing everyone can agree on is normalization. People will get bored of the chaos that is constantly going on, but then again, could they even be affected since we are all technically immortal?
