I know a lot of very excellent religious/faith in god type people who very much take a \u201cyeah idk if I\u2019m right but this is the premise/belief system I have faith in\u201d and we have had lots of lovely discussions where we share our belief systems with one another and it\u2019s not a problem. Neither of us is trying to fix the other ones belief system because that\u2019s not what faith is. Faith is something that enriches their lives, makes them feel better, and helps them be kinder people. It doesn\u2019t have to perfectly explain the universe or make perfect sense all the time. It brings them comfort, a community, and makes them happier people. They are more comfortable with the concept of an unknowable ineffable sky daddy. I like the idea that god if extant is just a poor overworked programmer trying desperately to patch all the bugs in the universe and lowkey making it worse at least half the time.

The ones that get angry and go no this true no doubt what\u2019s wrong with you for questioning me come to jesus or go to hell I classify as fanatics and consider them problematic at best. For me, I am a better friend because I concentrate my objections around problematic and frequently harmful aspects of organized religion (of which imo there are many) instead of demonizing faith in explanations for the unknowable (given current science limitations) I just kinda go, well we don\u2019t know either way, I have faith that yours doesn\u2019t make any sense and sky daddy\u2019s not real, but you have faith in sky dad. Neither of us knows so it\u2019s at most conclusive an interesting philosophical exercise. Faith doesn\u2019t auto jump everyone onto the kill shun and fix or torch the nonbelievers train.
