Why do you think this?\n\nThe fact that Francis Bacon was religious does not imply that he was thinking about religion when he came up with the scientific method.\n\nMore than likely, he was thinking philosophically and realized that philosophy cannot answer questions about the physical world because it has no test for correctness.\n\nThere is quite literally nothing in the Christian religion that would point toward the scientific method. And, very often, Christians actively opposed science as soon as it came up with answers that differed from the Bible, such as a heliocentric view of the solar system.\n\nI don't see how your logic is working here.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629043241.0, "parent_id": "t1_h91hwo3", "replies": [{"author": "Btankersly66", "id": "h93d0gy", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #169", "submission": "p4pzcu", "stickied": false, "body": "First I'm a Naturalist.
