There is general agreement that, with the possible exception of Paul, we know far more about Jesus of Nazareth than about any first or second century Jewish or pagan religious teacher.  \nEhrman (2012b, p. 4\u20135): \"Serious historians of the early Christian movement\u2014all of them\u2014have spent many years preparing to be experts in their field. Just to read the ancient sources requires expertise in a range of ancient languages: Greek, Hebrew, Latin, and often Aramaic, Syriac, and Coptic, not to mention the modern languages of scholarship (for example, German and French). And that is just for starters. Expertise requires years of patiently examining ancient texts and a thorough grounding in the history and culture of Greek and Roman antiquity, the religions of the ancient Mediterranean world, both pagan and Jewish, knowledge of the history of the Christian church and the development of its social life and theology, and, well, lots of other things. **It is striking that virtually everyone who has spent all the years needed to attain these qualifications is convinced that Jesus of Nazareth was a real historical figure.**\"  \n\n-----\n\n> **The Christ myth theory is rejected by mainstream scholarship**:\nRobert E. Van Voorst, referring to G.A. Wells: \"The nonhistoricity thesis has always been controversial, and it has consistently failed to convince scholars of many disciplines and religious creeds... **Biblical scholars and classical historians now regard it as effectively refuted\"**.[4]  \nWhile discussing the \"striking\" fact that \"we don't have any Roman records, of any kind, that attest to the existence of Jesus,\" Ehrman dismisses claims that this means Jesus never existed, saying, **\"He certainly existed, as virtually every competent scholar of antiquity, Christian or non-Christian, agrees, based on clear and certain evidence.\"**[27]  \nRobert M. Price, a former fundamentalist apologist who is now a Christian atheist, says the existence of Jesus cannot be ruled out, but is less probable than non-existence, agrees that his perspective runs against the views of the majority of scholars.[28]    \nMichael Grant, a classicist, states:  **\"In recent years, 'no serious scholar has ventured to postulate the non historicity of Jesus,' or at any rate very few, and they have not succeeded in disposing of the much stronger, indeed very abundant, evidence to the contrary.\"**[29]  \n\"There are those who argue that Jesus is a figment of the Church\u2019s imagination, that there never was a Jesus at all. **I have to say that I do not know any respectable critical scholar who says that any more.\"** [30]    \nMaurice Casey, an irreligious Emeritus Professor of New Testament Languages and Literature at the University of Nottingham, concludes in his book Jesus: Evidence and Argument or Mythicist Myths? that \"the whole idea that Jesus of Nazareth did not exist as a historical figure is verifiably false. **Moreover, it has not been produced by anyone or anything with any reasonable relationship to critical scholarship.
