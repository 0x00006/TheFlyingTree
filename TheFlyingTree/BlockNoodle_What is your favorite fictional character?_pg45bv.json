We enjoyed them enough to finish but equally enjoyed comparing what we didn't like. We would never have made the connection to Christianity, it just wouldn't have occurred to us to even consider it. State schooling in suburban South East England during the 70s/80s was as far from religious as possible. Even the lip service paid by morning assembly would have only encouraged our total lack of any interest. \n\n.\n\n\nI think a lot of these things are really good in one or some areas but not so good in others.
