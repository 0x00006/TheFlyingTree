I agree, the internet is awesome--in some ways. I've been using it since high school, and my career wouldn't be my career if the internet didn't exist. I'd probably still only be able to get jobs I absolutely can't stand. Every job I had before ecommerce/ordering stuff online became big business sucked.\n\nBut I think dating is significantly harder than it used to be, not really because of the internet but for other reasons--though I think trying to date online is full of such nonsense and shallow shit. Young people are meaner than they used to be and the internet gives them a powerful weapon against other people they dislike--saying this as someone who was bullied/picked on a lot growing up, I have to be so grateful for not being in that same spot today as a young person. The internet puts as much bad info in people's hands as it does good/useful info. And the quality of young people's in-school education seems to have decreased an unbelievable amount, making it more of a necessity for a young person to care and take initiative themselves to know anything other than basics and to become better at more than just using technology (talking about the US).\n\nThe times we're in right now just socioculturally and financially also suck significantly compared to the 80s and 90s, and probably the 70s, too (wasn't born in the 70s).

I probably have an unfair advantage in that department though, as I have a degree in history which is for effect a degree in writing.

I probably have an unfair advantage in that department though, as I have a degree in history which is for effect a degree in writing.\n\nThat certainly would give you a strong advantage in expressing yourself. I know that I managed to get all the way to my Technical Writing course without being able to write coherently. My college required both that and a writing elective above that mostly because at the time they were one of only 25 colleges in the country offering a 4 year degree in technical writing. So, even computer science majors had to take Technical Writing and a \"Group A elective\", for which I chose Art of Prose. That was basically more technical writing. My teacher was the same for both classes and was truly excellent, at least at getting through to me.\n\n> I know that language has some, likely significant, effect influences our thinking process. Makes sense of course, it's hard to think about how many different kinds of snowfall there are if you only have one word for it. Or what the difference is between a donkey and mule if they're both the same word.\n\nTrue. I once heard it said that the purpose of an education is to make your brain a fun place to spend the rest of your life.\n\nWe may take interests in very different things. But, having a decent command of the language probably is important for most people in being able to think clearly about whatever those interests are. I understand that some people actually think in images. I don't know how common that is. I definitely think in words.\n\n> Meanwhile I constantly observe some people who struggle to explain anything complex and it's obviously a sign that they don't understand it\n\nI strongly agree with this. I've worked with a number of people for whom English is a second language. Many of the people I've worked with apologized more than once that their English was not good.\n\nI have never had a problem understanding anyone for whom the concept they were trying to get across was clear in their own brain.\n\nPresumably, they were thinking in their native languages and then translating. As long as they were clear about what they were thinking, they always found a way to get their point across clearly, even across a language barrier.\n\nWhenever something wasn't clear, I'd see my coworkers giving people benefit of the doubt that the problem was just a language issue. In the end, it was never a language issue. If it sounded *fuzzy* coming out of their mouths, it was because it was fuzzy in their brain. They weren't clear about the issue in any language.\n\nI've also had this with native English speakers who, like a neutered dog, just didn't get it.\n\nThis is all anecdotal. It's just my personal experience. However, it's personal experience from numerous cases over 23 years as a programmer. That includes cases where someone's English was less than perfect but their brain was excellent as well as cases of varying qualities of English speaking (including native speakers) whose brains were far from excellent.\n\nRegardless of whether someone speaks English well, if they can think clearly in any language, they'll be clear. If they can't think clearly, it doesn't matter what language they use for thinking, nothing will help.\n\n> I can't help but wonder if it's their shitty vocabulary that's been holding them back their whole lives.\n\nThat is very possible. I can't be sure. In the cases of those who thought clearly but didn't speak English as well, I assume they're thinking clearly in their native language. It seems likely that they at least have a decent or better vocabulary in that language. I can't know that either way, of course.\n\n> Does everyone just get smarter if you teach them new and more complex words and phrases? I guess it makes sense that they would.\n\nI think if someone is not smart to begin with, they may fail to learn to think in complex words and phrases. They may not have the ability to understand the nuance.\n\nI think we all have our limitations. Nothing I could ever have learned could have made me the next Einstein. It was just not going to happen.\n\n>  *\u201cAlpha children wear grey. They work much harder than we do, because they're so frightfully clever. I'm awfully glad I'm a Beta, because I don't work so hard. And then we are much better than the Gammas and Deltas. Gammas are stupid. They all wear green, and Delta children wear khaki. Oh no, I don't want to play with Delta children. And Epsilons are still worse. They're too stupid to be able to read or write. Besides they wear black, which is such a beastly color. I'm so glad I'm a Beta.\u201d* \u2015 Aldous Huxley, Brave New World\n\nI'm just glad to be smart enough to have an idea of what the truly brilliant people on the planet have learned. I'm not one of them. I'm a Beta.\n\nBack to the topic of this wacko though, I'm not sure just how much of their problem is language. Certainly, they don't read the conclusions of their own cited papers with a critical eye.\n\nOne such paper that tried to make things sound better for psi powers than they were able to prove had a discussion section where they stated that their own results were slight and possibly not conclusive. And, the authors of the study also correctly noted that only 34% of such studies were able to reproduce their results.\n\nSomehow, this didn't trigger the in*duh*vidual I was discussing this with to say \"wait a minute!\" They did not realize that what this means is that the results barely indicated anything at all. Further, 2/3rds of the studies on the subject actively contradicted their findings.\n\nTranslation: They did not prove psi powers exist.\n\nSomehow this person missed that. This could be a real language issue or a critical thinking issue.\n\nThat said, I don't believe that my difficulty in understanding their point came from a lack of their *ability* to explain it. I think it came from an actively disingenuous attempt to railroad the conversation and steer it away from both the point of the OP and the point in my reply such that they could find an excuse to preach their own beliefs about psi powers, quantum communication between brains, and if they reply again, presumably something about an afterlife.\n\nI think their difficulty in explaining to me in particular is that I'm not willing to let the conversation be railroaded that way. I have no objection to tangents. I just want the person to be up front about what point they're actually trying to make. I think this person was attempting to get me to admit false facts a little at a time and then go down a road to more and more outlandish claims.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1627226434.0, "parent_id": "t1_h6epdmv", "replies": [{"author": "DDumpTruckK", "id": "h6hvkob", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #79", "submission": "oqhtnj", "stickied": false, "body": "Lol yep that's the same guy and some of the same studies he shoved at me.
