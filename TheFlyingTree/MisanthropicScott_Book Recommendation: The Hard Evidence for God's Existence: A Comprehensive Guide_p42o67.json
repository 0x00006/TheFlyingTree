Jenkins\n\nThough I've chosen to link to GoodReads rather than to Amazon, I feel I should include this spoiler from the Amazon website. It might save you a few bucks.\n\n> The perfect gift for the atheists in your life! This **completely blank book** is guaranteed to get a laugh every time you open the cover!\n\n> Since the time of St. Augustine, theologians and scientists alike have been desperately searching for evidence of God's existence. With this ground-breaking work, Dr. Jenkins provides the final line in this centuries old debate. After exhaustively searching through the scientific record, Dr. Jenkins has compiled this comprehensive guide to all of the concrete, scientific proof which points towards God's existence. This is an illuminating read for anyone curious about the historic clash between religion and science.\n\nAnyway, I just thought this might be good for a laugh. I'm not recommending actually purchasing it ... unless you want it as a coffee table book to surprise your friends and family ... or as a gift for an atheist you know and love.", "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.58, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/p42o67/book_recommendation_the_hard_evidence_for_gods/", "id": "p42o67", "author": "MisanthropicScott", "link_flair_text": "Humour", "num_comments": 13, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628921386.0, "comments": [{"author": "FalconRelevant", "id": "h8vsu16", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Archon", "submission": "p42o67", "stickied": false, "body": "Is it one of those blank pages books?

His audiobooks are on YouTube. The book of Enoch was removed from the bible around the 12 hundreds. All bibles were destroyed & replaced without the book of Enoch. A obscure tribe of Ethiopian Jews were overlooked & archaeologists discovered a copy. It discusses the Anunnaki & other topics deemed controversial by the Vatican. It is also available free as audiobook on YouTube. I can converse with confidence about the bible but don\u2019t consider myself a christian. If god knows what I\u2019m going to do before I do it, then I can conclude that he knows what everyone of us will do before we are born. Perhaps before he even created the earth. How can our ancestors or us be condemned for anything? The tribes in the Amazon have not heard about Jesus, Allah or the vast crowd of other gods that have come & gone. How can they be judged? The bible has been edited and changed many times. Recently the word booty was exchanged for plunder as it was causing mirth at Sunday schools. Perhaps Velikovsky was right? Perhaps the bible is loosely correct? If our universe previously had 2 suns & Saturn is the remnants of a brown dwarf sun that Earth was tidally locked to. Until Saturn underwent a nova event & it\u2019s core ejected that became a comet that caused havoc in our universe for decades until finally becoming the planet Venus. If god is the power source that some of our astronomers refer to as a black hole in the centre of our galaxy. Then he did sacrifice his sun (Saturn) to create our current universe. Electric universe theory is much more credible than our current theories. No need for the mysterious dark energy in a electro/magnetic plasma driven universe.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629202161.0, "parent_id": "t3_p42o67", "replies": [{"author": "MisanthropicScott", "id": "h9bn74o", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Druid #6 | Ordo Cognitus", "submission": "p42o67", "stickied": false, "body": "In general, my understanding is that stellar evolution (the changes a star undergoes throughout it's existence) is way more predictable than biological evolution (which is why Darwin didn't use the term evolution but instead said descent with modification).\n\nWhat this means is that we can actually tell, according to my understanding, that Saturn is not the remnant of a star other than by the fact that our whole solar system formed out of the gas cloud remnant of a supernova (which gave us the heavier elements than hydrogen and helium).\n\nJupiter is larger than Saturn and fell a bit short of critical mass. I see no reason to think Saturn was itself ever a sun.\n\nNow, if God is the black hole in the center of a galaxy, why ours? Out of the billions of galaxies in the observable universe, each of which probably has it's own supermassive black hole at the center, why ours? Why not Andromeda, the galaxy with which we are on a collision course? Andromeda is the bigger galaxy relative to our own.\n\nAnyway, just my thoughts on the subject. I've never heard of electric universe theory. It doesn't seem to be mainstream when I google it.\n\nWhat actually drives me nuts is when scientists misuse the term theory to mean something other than [*scientific theory*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_theory). They do this all the time without any concern for the massive confusion it causes in the general public.\n\n> A **scientific theory** is an explanation of an aspect of the natural world and universe that can be repeatedly tested and verified in accordance with the scientific method, using accepted protocols of observation, measurement, and evaluation of results. Where possible, theories are tested under controlled conditions in an experiment.[1][2] In circumstances not amenable to experimental testing, theories are evaluated through principles of abductive reasoning. Established scientific theories have withstood rigorous scrutiny and embody scientific knowledge.[3] \n\nThings that are not scientific theories and may not even be scientific hypotheses yet include: string ~~theory~~, M-~~theory~~, multiverse ~~theory~~, simulation ~~theory~~, etc.\n\nElectric universe ~~theory~~ also appears very very far from being a scientific theory at present.\n\nThings that are actually scientific theories, such as the theory of general relativity, quantum theory, and the theory of natural selection, are so thoroughly tested and verified that we can build technology based on them, such as GPS systems, computers, and modern medicine, respectively.\n\nSo, no. Electric universe theory is not even close to as credible as the theory of general relativity which has withstood over a century of in depth tests showing the curvature of spacetime via stellar parallax, the distortion of time based on motion and gravity wells, and most recently verifying the existence of frame dragging and gravitational waves that were predicted by the theory almost 100 years before we could build sensitive enough equipment to test them.", "is_submitter": true, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629228145.0, "parent_id": "t1_h9a3n6b", "replies": [{"author": "SybariteAussie", "id": "h9chpxo", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #177", "submission": "p42o67", "stickied": false, "body": "Thunderbolts project on YouTube & Wallace Thornhill expand on the theories discussed by Velikovsky. Einstein\u2019s gravity driven universe theory has mathematical flaws. The term dark energy is ethereal. With modern telescopes we can see that the canals on Mars are more consistent with evidence of a plasma discharge than the presence of water. Velikovsky uses geological evidence, ancient mythology & cave paintings to support his theories. The geological evidence alone is compelling. Recent NASA probes confirmed Velikovsky\u2019s prediction that both Saturn & Jupiter emit more energy than they receive from the sun. If Earth was tidally locked to either Saturn or Jupiter. There would perhaps have been eternal summer, 24 hours a day. It would explain the presence of the vast fields of pachyderm skeletons in Siberia among other things. There\u2019s a island off the coast of Siberia that consists of mammoth skeletons and sand. Pachyderm skeletons have been discovered in Britain. Siberian\u2019s harvest the flesh from the fields of mammoth skeletons to feed their sled dogs. The skeletons were snap frozen, still have eyeballs present & undigested food in their stomachs or in their mouths. Rivers have been discovered with herds of large animals frozen in the process of crossing the river. Schools of fish snap frozen. Velikovsky, Wallace Thornhill & Thunderbolts project explain things far better than a novice like me can. Velikovsky & Einstein were peers & friends. I am not asserting that I am correct. Velikovsky\u2019s use of geological evidence alone is difficult to ignore. Worlds in collision, Ages in chaos & Earth in upheaval by Velikovsky are available as audiobooks on YouTube. I thoroughly enjoyed them! Thunderbolts project have some shorter documentaries that are easier to digest if you are short of spare time. Remembering the end of the world, Thunderbolts of the gods, symbols of an alien sky (has 3 episodes) are well worth a watch. Science in particular should be a open book & open to discussion. My own observations of the moon with my telescope indicate that the so called craters on the moon seem more consistent with electric/plasma discharge. Sun spots are difficult to explain with a nuclear powered sun but fit comfortably with a electro/magnetic plasma driven sun.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629241442.0, "parent_id": "t1_h9bn74o", "replies": [{"author": "MisanthropicScott", "id": "h9drybo", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Druid #6 | Ordo Cognitus", "submission": "p42o67", "stickied": false, "body": "What do you view as the reason that most of this is not more generally accepted?", "is_submitter": true, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629268273.0, "parent_id": "t1_h9chpxo", "replies": [{"author": "SybariteAussie", "id": "h9e3azb", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #177", "submission": "p42o67", "stickied": false, "body": "Velikovsky was widely condemned by the scientific community. Considered as something reminiscent of a heretic. They were burning his books @ Harvard. Prominent scientists formed a cabal. Forced the publisher to cease publishing a best selling book. My counsel is to listen or read them yourself & form your own opinions. Many previous forbidden subjects are being reconsidered. Due to data from probes to planets, moons & comets. A few years ago a comet was seen breaking up, being zapped before it crashed into Jupiter. Scientists risk losing funding or being cancelled if they challenge the narrative. The search for dark energy is being funded. Bill Bryson discusses some amusing feuds and rivalries between scientists in his book. A short history of nearly everything. Often innovators are initially faced with derision and contempt. The doctor that proved stomach ulcers could be cured with antibiotics had to deliberately infect himself in front of a audience then take the antibiotics to cure himself before being believed. The doctor that suggested washing hands before assisting child birth would reduce infant mortality rates was ridiculed. Many doctors went from performing autopsies to delivering children without washing their hands. Many medical advances initially met stiff resistance. The more educated or knowledgeable a person considers themselves. The more likely that they will be unhappy when proved wrong or even challenged. Hubris is understandable. Well funded scientists agreeing with those in charge of funding is also understandable. Astronomers are being challenged by mathematicians as the numbers don\u2019t add up.
