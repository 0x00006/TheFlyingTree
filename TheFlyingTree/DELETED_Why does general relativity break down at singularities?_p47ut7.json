A singularity is a point at which a mathematical object (usually a function) is not defined or lacks a property we find important (like continuity or differentiability). \n\nGiven this, we can think of simple cases of singularities in Newtonian gravitation that are easier to understand. Think of the Universal Law of Gravitation: F = GMm/r^2 . Not too complicated, it's basically a fancy f(x) = 1/x^2 function. This function has an obvious singularity: x=0. Dividing by 0 is not defined, and therefore, x=0 is a singularity. \n\nIn a sense, a similar thing is happening in general relativity. The \"singularity\" is just the mathematical representation of our inability to model what happens when a black hole, for example, appears (beyond the event horizon and such things, we can't analyze the thing that has the mass itself).", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628952366.0, "parent_id": "t1_h8wxxk4", "replies": [{"author": "DELETED", "id": "h90nltp", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": null, "submission": "p47ut7", "stickied": false, "body": "ohhhhhhh so a singularity isnt really an object of its own its a representation.. kinda like infinity. it isnt a number, per say, its an idea... thanks for your response it really cleared things up :)", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629025010.0, "parent_id": "t1_h8wyztf", "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"author": "kemperus", "id": "h8wq43l", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #134", "submission": "p47ut7", "stickied": false, "body": "I think it\u2019s because gravity is infinite, or does it cause infinite gravity?
