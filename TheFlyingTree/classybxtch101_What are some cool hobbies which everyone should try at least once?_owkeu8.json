My own experience validates those ideas for me.\n\nFor anyone who's interested in giving it a try, there are of course innumerable resources online, but I'd recommend Stephen LaBerge's *Lucid Dreaming: A Concise Guide to Awakening in Your Dreams and in Your Life*.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1627935091.0, "parent_id": "t3_owkeu8", "replies": [{"author": "Alatain", "id": "h7jid65", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #31", "submission": "owkeu8", "stickied": false, "body": "It can also help with dealing with sleep issues like night terrors and sleep paralysis.

I can fix almost anything around the house, could do so since I was a teenager. Not so much because I explicitly learned how to do it, but rather because I did a lot of different crafts. Woodworking, model airplane building (long before plastics and drones took over), metal working, knitting, etc... I know exactly what glue to use for a job (hint: if you are using hot glue, it's almost surely the wrong type of glue for the job) or can fix a thorn seam. Need another power outlet somewhere? No problem, and it will be up to code. Antenna for an amateur radio station?
