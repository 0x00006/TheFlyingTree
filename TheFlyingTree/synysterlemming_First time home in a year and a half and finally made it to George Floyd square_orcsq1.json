That's right. Training. Cops need more of it, and that costs money. Police training is already dogshit. Cops should learn Jitsu. They should box each other. They should punch each other in the face. As Donut once said, \"If you're a police officer and you've never been punched in the face, then you're wrong\". \n\nPolice are already drastically underfunded and unequipped. Many departments don't even have bodycams on all of their officers. Smaller departments don't even give their officers tasers since they are expensive as hell. Patrol rifles are incredibly rare, and they save lives. Non lethal options are also incredibly rare. \n\n>Elimination of chokeholds\n\nThose are already banned in a lot of agencies around the country. But they save lives. In Jitsu, there are a bunch of choke holds which can knock someone out in a couple seconds. You cut off blood flow to the brain, they pass out, you let go, detain them, and a few seconds later, they are back. Not dangerous, but very good at knocking someone out. \n\n>Documentation when force is used. \n\nThat's.... already a thing. Whenever an officer uses force, they must write a use of force report. That's the case *everywhere*. Serious incidents get reported to the FBI. Less serious incidents just stay within the department. This is NYC's policy on Use of Force reports. https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/nypd/downloads/pdf/use-of-force/use-of-force-2018.pdf It basically requires officers to write a report if they do pretty much anything other than talk to the suspect and arrest them (or something along those lines). Hitting, tasing, pepper spray, tackling, etc. According to shotspotter.com, \"Use of force could mean physical strikes, but in some jurisdictions, it could also mean yelling loudly into the face of an individual.\"", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1627267925.0, "parent_id": "t1_h6i2tqc", "replies": []}, {"author": "Eyesyt", "id": "h6i382l", "score": -1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "", "submission": "orcsq1", "stickied": false, "body": "Fine, attempted murders every day, not all are fatal. 187 shootings before june 1st.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1627239527.0, "parent_id": "t1_h6i2tqc", "replies": []}]}, {"author": "s1gnalZer0", "id": "h6iteef", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #16", "submission": "orcsq1", "stickied": false, "body": ">if they don't want police, we shouldn't force it on them.
