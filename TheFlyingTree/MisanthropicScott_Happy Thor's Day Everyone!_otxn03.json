I definitely don't get things right all the time either.\n\nYes, as the article discusses, the Vikings were driven out by a number of factors, to include the Inuit people and the environment, and a lack of cultural and environmental adaptation, or simply the wrong adaptations, ironic, given that Vikings are stereotypically viewed as thriving in cold climates.\n\nThe Vikings weren't just raiders and fighters, but traders, farmers and settlers as well. White supremacists like to fantasize about how they were some pure race (they were not) whose whole purpose in life was to murder everyone who wasn't a Viking or wasn't white. That's a whole lotta bullshit and some neo-nazi/alt-right wet dream.\n\nI'm not an expert myself on the subject, but I know that the Vikings actually traded with the Inuit, probably even intermingled at some point. According to some accounts, they were themselves also attacked by the Inuit as well, some Viking settlements were supposedly even slaughtered by the Inuit as the Vikings strayed further into Inuit territory. Ultimately though, it was their failure to properly adapt to the land and the environment that did them in, in Greenland. It's likely that their conversion to the Roman Catholic church was a factor as well, forcing lifestyle changes on the Viking people that were counter to their own survival.\n\nAs far as Diamond, he has been called a pseudointellectual.
