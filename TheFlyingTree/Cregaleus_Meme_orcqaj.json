It's a very odd coincidence that the corona virus was transmitted to humans in the exact location that they were studying corona virus transmission to humans. So let's calculate the probability.

Now what's the chance that it would happen to be the same virus they were studying at wuhan? That's a bit hard to calculate, but let's say it was inevitable for the corona virus to be transmitted to humans some time in the next 20 years, and that's why they were researching it. They studied the virus for 17 years, so that doesn't change it too much.  So we have a 1 in 361.1 chance. The chance that it's all coincidence is 1/361.
