To join the Secret Science Club mailing list (or just request the Zoom link), send an email to the address on their blogspot page.\n\nAt the next Secret Science Club, neuroscientist and co-founder of the Thai Elephant Orchestra David Sulzer artfully investigates the science behind music, hearing, and sound. He asks:\n\n* How are emotions carried by music?\n\n* Why are there musical scales?\n\n* What does it mean when something is out-of-tune?\n\n* Do other animals hear differently than we do?\n\n* Why are sounds different from each other, and how do we know it?\n\n**Before & After**\n\n* Mix up our finely tuned cocktail of the night, the Vibrato\u2026 (recipe below!)\n\n* Groove to wild instrumentals\n\n* Bring your questions for the live Q&A\n\n* Snag a copy of David Sulzer\u2019s new book, Music, Math, and Mind: The Physics and Neuroscience of Music here. Use code CUP20 for 20% off when you order on the Columbia University Press website.\n\nDavid Sulzer is a professor in the Departments of Psychiatry, Neurology, and Pharmacology at Columbia University Medical Center. His laboratory has made important contributions to the study of brain mechanisms involved in autism, Parkinson\u2019s disease, drug addiction, and learning and memory. He is also a composer and performer under the name Dave Soldier and has worked with many major figures in the classical, jazz, and pop worlds, appearing on over 100 records. Some of his projects bridge music and neuroscience, including the Thai Elephant Orchestra, an orchestra of fourteen elephants in northern Thailand, and the Brainwave Music Project, which uses EEGs of brain activity to create compositions.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n---\n\nI am not affiliated with the Secret Science Club other than by being a long time attendee of their events. Since I've almost always enjoyed their events, I figured I'd share. To get the link to zoom, you need to get on their email list. They do not bombard with emails, just the twice a month emails for their approximately monthly events, first notice then the link the day before the event.\n\nA small donation for the event is nice but not required. My wife and I give $5/pp for each event we attend. Anything or nothing at all is fine.", "score": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/p7nk9k/free_live_event_via_zoom_august_25th_8pm_2000_est/", "id": "p7nk9k", "author": "MisanthropicScott", "link_flair_text": "Event", "num_comments": 1, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629406852.0, "comments": [{"author": "dogs_like_me", "id": "h9mhw74", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #156", "submission": "p7nk9k", "stickied": false, "body": "Reminds me of a group I used to hang with that would have parties to compete for the best drunk lightning talks (complete with powerpoint)", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629433929.0, "parent_id": "t3_p7nk9k", "replies": []}]}
