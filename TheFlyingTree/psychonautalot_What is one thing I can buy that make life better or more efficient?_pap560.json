Crows have been observed making tools in the wild. And, if they make a particularly good one, they may cache it for later reuse.\n\n> Hayden Planetarium\u2014I don't really get starstruck by celebrities, but I'd still love to have a chance to spot Neil deGrasse Tyson. I listen to StarTalk sometimes. Neat that their projector is so detailed.\n\nSeeing Neil was a lot easier before he became such a celebrity. The planetarium used to have two simultaneous lecture series (now it only has one). It used to have Distinguished Authors, which was generally an author doing a book signing and lecture pertaining to a new book. The other was Frontiers in Astronomy and Astrophysics, which was generally a young-ish scientist explaining their ongoing research.\n\nAt least through the late 1990s, Neil used to introduce the speaker at almost every lecture. First, he'd do about a 20 minute ramble about current events in science. Even when the lecturer was truly great, Neil's 20 minute \"intro\" was often the best part.\n\nFor the authors series, I've seen Lisa Randall, Leonard Suskind, Lee Smolin, and many more. For the frontiers series, I remember in the 1990s a lecturer on the team who discovered that the universe was not only expanding, but was also accelerating. The work hadn't been published yet.\n\nNow, when Neil does something at the museum, it's a huge event like the year in review or the Asimov memorial debate. Tickets either sell out very fast or they use some strategy to avoid them going instantaneously, like silently posting the even on their calendar without a notification.\n\nThese events don't even take place in the planetarium. They're in the museum's Lefrak theater, which is about Broadway theater size, give or take a bit. (google break) My mistake. At 924 seats, it's bigger than most broadway theaters.\n\nIn Lefrak, they usually have really big names. I've seen Jane Goodall and David Attenborough (separately) in that venue. It's also where they show their 3D imax movies.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629910498.0, "parent_id": "t1_haaucva", "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"author": "sweber145", "id": "ha6exr4", "score": 3, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #68", "submission": "pap560", "stickied": false, "body": "Things for a hobby.
