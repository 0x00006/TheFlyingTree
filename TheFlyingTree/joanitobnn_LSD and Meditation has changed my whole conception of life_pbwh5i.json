Bang. My big brother just didn't want to talk to me at all and ignored me even though I tried so hard to be friends with him. Bang X2. I grew up alone, cuz mom was working all day long and my father just gave up on his kids and never saw him again since I was 7. Grew up in front of a computer screen masturbating since 8. Bang X3.\n\nThese things hurt a lot and damaged me and my attitude. I tried to stay strong even though I wasn't.\n\nTo sum up ive had mild depression since I was pretty young so I didn't even know what it was like to be happy.\n\nI was about to quit life after 2+ years of smoking marihuana and everyday (started at 17, now I'm 20). \nThen I started watching videos about Wim Hof and his method (breathwork and cold showers). I started feeling a little bit better yet my addiction was still there. Then I got the willpower to quit, i started meditating, reading, more often, and so far so good I'm getting just a 1% better everyday. \n\nYesterday I had an LSD trip with some friends, and i first felt in my life a REAL connection. I'm the kind of guy to dream while I'm awake and always disconnected at some point when I was hanging out. Now that was different. My mood and everyone's else was like \"moving \" with the mood of the group (7 20 y olds). We went on hiking and it was such an adventure. We finally got home late night and it was so dark we could event climb down the mountain.\n\nAt this point I was tripping and feeling good. It was like i was being my \"real\" self. No faking, just fully present, like in a meditative state. We sat forming a circle and i guided my friends through a breathing to calm us down, then 2 bats started flying in circles right above our heads, and disappeared right away... Then I looked my phone and it was 22:22 22 august... It may seem like a coincidence but it was mind-blowing when you're on LSD. This experience changed my perception on life and myself.\n\nHave you ever tried lsd or any hallucinogenic?

You're aware of the trip, yet you still can't do anything about how you feel about it. Imagination goes wild. Things taste so good. Music is awesome. Auditory hallucinations are everywhere, that's what I most noticed. Visual ones too, but definitely nothing crazy. \n\nIf it's going good, it's fun. I had a few \"deep\" thoughts and definitely learned how to relax a bit more, but it didn't really change  my way of living life. The second time I tried them it wasn't as fun.
