Not all earthquakes will cause tsunamis because not all earthquakes cause water to be displaced.\n\nIn a tsunami, an earthquake causes a slip fracture of some plate, and the crack propagates to the surface. This causes the surface of the plate, aka the ocean floor to move. This affects the entire column of water above the bit that moved, which then radiates that motion outward.\n\nThe surface of the water will probably not show much. Tsunamis are different from regular surface waves in that the wave is through the entire column of water, instead of just moving along the top. At most there might be a meter or two of displacement rolling along the surface.\n\nIt is only when the wave moving through the water reaches shallower or concentrating geography that the power really makes itself known. It forces all the energy into smaller and smaller volumes of water, pushing it up above the default surface.\n\nA better way to think of the water part of a tsunami is that the earthquake wave and subsequent water displacement moves through the water and temporarily raises the sea level. It's literally a big slosh.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629982650.0, "parent_id": "t1_haem1e8", "replies": [{"author": "Arisdoodlesaurus", "id": "haff6tr", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #102", "submission": "pbvkvt", "stickied": false, "body": "This is the best explanation of the formation of a tsunami.

Also for Switzerland, were tsunamis actually occurred in the past, there is neither a warning system and also most likely to late once the earthquake has been registered as the lakes are not that big. \n\nBe aware that the water can also be displaced due to large volumes and  rocks and sediments shifting in or into a lake. This can be due to an earthquake or just because the whole thing becomes unstable. For Switzerland there is a recorded tsunami in lake Lucerne in the [year 1601 (earthquake)](https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/sci-tech/science-saturday_how-much-of-a-risk-are-tsunamis-in-switzerland-/44399838)  and 1687 (under water land slide).
