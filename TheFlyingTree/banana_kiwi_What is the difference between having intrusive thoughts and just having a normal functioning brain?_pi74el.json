It's like a stream that you cannot just stop and fine-tune. You may be able to broadly guide the stream one way or another but you don't have the ability to filter out certain items however you want. The thoughts will come either way.\n\nAnd it's perfectly normal and natural to have dark thoughts in addition to happier thoughts throughout your day. The thoughts come back up and go away. Then come back up later. You don't know when, you're just along for the ride.\n\nSo then, having repetitive, unwanted dark thoughts should just be a normal aspect of being a human being. Right? It's not something we can get rid of without removing brain parts, so it's something we have to live with and accept.\n\nSo why does every authority talk about intrusive thoughts like they mean you have a disorder?

Like random ideas, thoughts, and decisions or impulses will occur. Dark thoughts are pretty normal too, and it's the person who has them who decides if they are dark or not. Us humans are primal creatures and thinking some things, as long as not acted upon, isn't necessary bad.\n\nIntrusive thoughts are something else. They are a thought that is often occupied by a trigger action and/or cause distress. Thinking something unpleasant than saying something to clear your mind, like interrupting your own thought by going, \"meow!\". Having a nervous or anxious reaction to a thought. Flinging a hand up in defence to some thought. Or even having a pain reaction upon thinking of something.\n\nThe thought is not wanted, it isn't brought to, and it doesn't have a logical reason for happening. Sure you can trace the logic as to why that thought at that time sometimes (not always at all), but the point of the thought is often not there itself.\n\nThe trick to getting rid of intrusive thoughts is to not think of them, to gain control over your own brain and for you to be the one who controls yourself. This can often be accomplished with age, meditation, and practising ego control.
