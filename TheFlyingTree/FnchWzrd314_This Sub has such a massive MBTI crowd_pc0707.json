But instead of like say a science club, we can call it \"everyone try and become dorky and just have fun club\", and it helps out a lot when you meet with people whom you feel are on similar trajectories or take similar approaches or preferences looking at the world. \n\nSo, a few reasons people don't give MBTI credits might be on the basis that \"humans should not be categorised into some construct of framework and no framework can accurately represent everyone, some even to the point of generalisation\" to which I would say, \"yes, but think about categories, we are on a daily, sorted according to our preferences, choices, values, even IQ tests, which can all be influenced, inaccurate and misrepresenting, but there are just labels, one more label doesn't really matter as long as you don't plaster it everywhere and use it as a limiter or a qualifier for yourself when you shouldn't really need to. This stems from an overuse of labels as limiter and qualifiers for certain actions, privileges, etc and people are tired of seeing them being flaunted everywhere. It even overshadows some real world categories that probably should afford the categorized these limiters or qualifiers. \n\nHowever, I did MBTI should be seen as what it is and should be given credit for what it is due. It does try to put into categories or at least present it in boxes of how decisions are approaches and influenced via cognitive functions. Its pseudoscience probably because it is a very difficult thing to empirically capture and replicate. But, the study of psychology has also faced similar issue, and to my understanding, had to change its definition from \"the study of the mind\" to \"the science of behavious\" simply because the mind itself is difficult to study and replicated for consistent experimentational results, not to say its impossible. So, I won't call it science or anything. Its probably safer just to take it as reference overall.\n\nAnd oddly enough, whether its the chicken or the egg first, I did meet a bunch of people whom I felt approach matters similarly to how I would, or at least within a range of agreeableness when it comes to selection of perspectives.
