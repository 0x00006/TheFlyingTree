I'll be straight up, this isn't the first secret sub I've been invited to, but it seems pretty cool.  Kinda curious about the invite algorithm.\n\nSo anyway, I'm crazymoefaux.  I like to rollerblade, and ride electric unicycles up mountains.  Life is pretty good, except that the rest of the world seems to be slowly going nuts.  I'd like to think I'm actually still pretty sane, though, despite my username.\n\nHow's everyone doing?", "score": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/pgccvm/i_think_ive_heard_of_this_place_before/", "id": "pgccvm", "author": "crazymoefaux", "link_flair_text": "Other", "num_comments": 13, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630564460.0, "comments": [{"author": "SybariteAussie", "id": "hbac3fh", "score": 3, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #177", "submission": "pgccvm", "stickied": false, "body": "Hi dude", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630564854.0, "parent_id": "t3_pgccvm", "replies": [{"author": "crazymoefaux", "id": "hbacdt6", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #482", "submission": "pgccvm", "stickied": false, "body": "Hello!", "is_submitter": true, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630565082.0, "parent_id": "t1_hbac3fh", "replies": [{"author": "SybariteAussie", "id": "hbaeqvg", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #177", "submission": "pgccvm", "stickied": false, "body": "Rock out with ya c0ck out! \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude0e", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630566982.0, "parent_id": "t1_hbacdt6", "replies": [{"author": "Nothemagain", "id": "hbapkbz", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #134", "submission": "pgccvm", "stickied": false, "body": "You.
