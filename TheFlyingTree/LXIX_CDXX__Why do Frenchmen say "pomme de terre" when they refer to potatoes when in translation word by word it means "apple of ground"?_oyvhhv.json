English is most closely related to Frisian and Low Saxon, while its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other Germanic languages, particularly Old Norse (a North Germanic language), as well as Latin and French.[6][7][8] \n\n[First paragraph of Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language)\n\nThat was all I was referring to.

Germanic tribes were inland and had to get through the Anglo-Saxons before they could reach Briton which made it more difficult for Germanic people to migrate to Briton and exert less influence on its culture and language.\n\nIf you look at the map it is clear there is much more migration between the Frankish and Briton coast as they are much closer together geographically and easier to reach than either the Anglo-Saxon coast or Germany.

The development of an Anglo-Saxon identity arose from the interaction between incoming groups of people from a number of Germanic tribes, both amongst themselves, and with indigenous British groups. Many of the natives, over time, adopted Anglo-Saxon culture and language and were assimilated. The Anglo-Saxons established the concept, and the Kingdom, of England, and though the modern English language owes somewhat less than 26% of its words to their language, this includes the vast majority of words used in everyday speech.\\[1\\]\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxons)", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628426894.0, "parent_id": "t1_h81x09o", "replies": [{"author": "WikiSummarizerBot", "id": "h85x4yd", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "", "submission": "oyvhhv", "stickied": false, "body": "**[Anglo-Saxons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxons)** \n \n >The Anglo-Saxons were a cultural group who inhabited England in the Early Middle Ages.

That period lasted for several centuries until the aftermath of the Hundred Years' War (1337\u20131453). However, English has continued to be influenced by French. According to Laura K.
