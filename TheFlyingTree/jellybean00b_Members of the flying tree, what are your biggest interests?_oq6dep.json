If you apply graph theory and computational rules to the way you move between nodes (along causal edges), you will find that the way the interactions and changes of the shapes these connections make in a given 'slice' of a graph represents the evolution of physical systems over time. \n\nIt's an evolution of ideas from cellular automata applied to N dimensions in an acasual framework, where time and space 'pop out' in the way that gliders or puffers 'pop out' of the rules of Conway's Game of Life. Apply the rules to the nodes, and evolve along a given timelike branch of the graph, and it looks like a physical system.\n\nTo hear them talking, it sounds like the meat of the idea is finding other aspects of physics. It seems to unite Quantum mechanics and General relativity by showing how they both arise from the same set of rules and how they're applications of those rules at differing scales, just like zooming in on one or two cells of a CA vs zooming out to see the whole infinite map. \n\nI'm Absolutely 100% sure I've got most of this wrong.
