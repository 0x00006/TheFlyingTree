Fines, speeding for example, are a flat rate. An individual that makes $200k/yr and gets a $500 speeding ticket can easily pay it off, where an individual making $30k/yr cannot. Does that encourage individuals of higher income to break rules more often as they are less effected by the penalties?

Sure the rich can get a taxi or use the very good public transportation as a taxis are freaking expensive to be used for daily and/or long distance transport. \n\nBut at the next stage, for more severe speeding or traffic offences (and also criminal offences), we actually have income based monetary penalties. They were introduced in lieu of short jail sentences. Jails are expensive. Accordingly they are measured in days and multiplied with how much you earn in a day. Also like jail sentences they can be on probation only and usually are (for two to three years) in case of first time offenders. However in such a case, where the sentence is on probation, there will be still a huge fine, and court fee, and a three month or more driving ban, and more admirative fees. \n\nExample: The judge decides your traffic infraction is worth 10 days the $200k/yr would get a monetary penalty of $ 5500, and the $30k/yr guy one of $ 820.

Taken as the only variable, you're probably correct.\n\nThe thing is that I sped a lot when I was young and stupid. The cost of the fine was not on my mind at all. Once I started to get older (which did correspond with greater income), I found that the way to avoid speeding tickets entirely was simply to set the cruise control to 8 MPH (U.S., obviously) above the speed limit. I never get pulled over now.\n\nI would also say that somewhere along the way, I realized that the fine of the ticket was nothing compared to the increase in insurance costs for at least 39 months (then, not sure about now).\n\nCompare that to my teens and early 20s when I was stupid enough to get a ticket for going 68 MPH (~110 km/h) in a 30 MPH (~50 km/h) zone.\n\nAlso strange here in the U.S., or at least where I live, is that the severity of the speeding violation is determined by miles per hour over the speed limit rather than a percentage over the speed limit. So, more than doubling the limit as I did above would be no worse than going 38 MPH over a 65 MPH speed limit.\n\nBoth are bad. But, the percentage over the limit is much worse in the first case.\n\nToday, I think things have changed so radically since that time that a single ticket that high over the limit might trigger a mandatory suspension/revocation hearing. Then it was just points on my license and a fine.\n\nLastly, a wealthy person is also more likely to pay a lawyer to come to court to try to beat the ticket.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630446524.0, "parent_id": "t3_pfdn7i", "replies": [{"author": "145676337", "id": "hb47428", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #116", "submission": "pfdn7i", "stickied": false, "body": "Fun fact, the UK also uses MPH.
