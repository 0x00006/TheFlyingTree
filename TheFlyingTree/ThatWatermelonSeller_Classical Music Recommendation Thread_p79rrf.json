The common thread is that they abandon previous convention. With abstract art you're not appreciating something that's a picture or interpretation of something else, you're enjoying the painting just for what it is, the shapes, the colors, and the design and how those things make you feel. Both atonal music and improv jazz ordinarily make no effort to play something that you might recognize as a melody. Atonal classical a collection of sounds - usually but not always played on musical instruments - to be appreciated just for what they are.

Anyone\u2019s welcome to ask me more about the pieces if they want, I love talking about them. \n\nFor example, the last piece is a part of a collection released by Bach called \u201cSei Solo\u201d. The name Sei Solo translates to \u201cYou\u2019re Alone\u201d, a name he gave the collection of pieces because he composed them in memory of his dead wife whom he loved a lot. A very very very cool thing about the collection, and the second partita in particular, is that there are many times when the violin creates two consecutive noises. Often, another violin can be heard playing along the main one, and even a voice can be noticed singing almost clearly towards the end.
