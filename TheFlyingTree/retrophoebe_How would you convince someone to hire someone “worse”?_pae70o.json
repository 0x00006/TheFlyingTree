Like, why would someone want to hire me when someone else could have gone through the same things mentally or otherwise and didn\u2019t need time away or didn\u2019t suffer academically. Doesn\u2019t that basically mean that applicant is stronger than I am? \n\nI\u2019ve been trying to spin it like, I know how to cope with things when it gets tough since I\u2019ve been there, but idk it just sounds like crap to me.

You're better. You need to feel that walking in the door. You need to walk that difficult and fine line between arrogance and low self-esteem that is *confidence*. It's not easy. And, I'm not all that good at interviewing.\n\nBut, keep this in mind. You have absolutely no idea who else has applied for the job. You very well might be the best candidate. Leave it to them to tell you that you're not. You have no reason to tell them that.\n\nEven if your skill set isn't exactly the best, if you are the best fit with the team you'll be working on, that can count for a lot. So, make sure to listen carefully to the questions you're being asked and fully understand them. Make sure they know you hear what they're telling you they want during the interview. Then do your best to give it to them.\n\nSome interviews may put you in a simulated position where you are doing the job during the interview. Take that seriously. Work through the problems. One of the best interviews I ever had, not only because I actually got the job but because I really thought that it tested for what was missing on most interviews, put me in the position of working with a few other people designing a hypothetical system. \n\nThe job was for a computer programming position. This part of the interview came after the basics but really showed whether a person was capable of working on a team of developers.\n\nIf you end up in a situation where they are presenting you with the opportunity to actually show how you can do the job, take it seriously and do your best.\n\nBe personable with your interviewers. Treat them as if they're your coworkers, your team. That is what they're likely interviewing you for. Be someone with whom they will actively want to work.\n\nGood luck!\n\nP.S. Remember, don't get discouraged by failing to get one job. If you interview at 12 places and get a single job, you've won.

Being out of college you went into your adult life crisis. You really needed to know what to do with your life. Even thought about doing other things, so you really needed to be sure.
