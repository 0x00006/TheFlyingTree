If so, what are your thoughts on it?\n\nI'll start, i like jeff's way of telling a story, i have also read his southern reach trilogy and i must say he is a master of the craft, even i dont really fully get his books. As for the book in questions themes, i think there are none but the inability of man to comprehend even a speck of the universe, and as for the literal things in the book, i think it's about an organism with lifecycle that uses entire planets to reproduce, there are also some deep parts about the nature of carnivorous organisms\n\nI inted to start a discussion", "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/oqu827/thoughts_on_the_world_is_full_of_monsters_by_jeff/", "id": "oqu827", "author": "UptightBean", "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "num_comments": 2, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1627147227.0, "comments": [{"author": "shig23", "id": "h6e7r4h", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Druid #5", "submission": "oqu827", "stickied": false, "body": "The only Vandemeer I\u2019ve read is Southern Reach.
