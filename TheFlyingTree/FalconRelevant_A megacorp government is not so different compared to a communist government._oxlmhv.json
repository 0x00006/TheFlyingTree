For the simplest proof of that: say an anarcho-communist society emerges, and say that there is a small percentage of people in this society who e.g. hoard property and use the means of production for personal benefits primarly. Such individuals will need to be somehow taken care of, in the simplest case by forceful removal. Such forceful removal can be of course carried out by any member of society, but assuming that there is a probobility of resistance it makes forceful removal dangerous - thus requiring skill. Therefore it would be optimal to delegate a group of individuals willing to risk health and possesing necessary skills to remove the unwilling to participate from the society. Then you have came up with police - a sure mark of state.\n\nSimilair processes will always lead to emergance of other marks of state such as law, wealth redistribution etc. No anarchist doctrine can be coherent as any anarchist society will evolve into a state at some point.
