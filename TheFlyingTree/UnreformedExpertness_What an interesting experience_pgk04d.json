When I think about this idea of a flying tree, it strikes me as a \"tie\" to the real world, with both whimsy and a little bit of philosophy. This tree, a grounded (pun intended) and necessary part of life, but in a unique place that also isn't unrealistic, but instead more of an imagined setting. \nApplying that to what I see here, druids, the tenders of the organisms on this planet and champions of the natural world, are here the longest, maybe watching the tree grow and pruning when necessary. \n\nLong winded, but all that to say, you have my attention in this space that has really tickled my brain this morning.
