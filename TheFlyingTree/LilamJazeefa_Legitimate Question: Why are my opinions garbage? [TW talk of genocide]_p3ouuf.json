{"title": "Legitimate Question: Why are my opinions garbage? [TW talk of genocide]", "name": "t3_p3ouuf", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/p3ouuf/legitimate_question_why_are_my_opinions_garbage/", "selftext": "I'm going to preface this post by stating that I'm going to try to word it as carefully and sensitively as possible.  I have a therapist and am not in danger, nor do I pose a danger to others.  I'm trying to convince myself of healthier ways of thinking, hence why I'm asking this on /r/TheFlyingTree, a place with a lot of diversity of opinion and where there's no pre-determined topic of the sub.  I am also not asking for medical advice (this is the internet and y'all're not medical professionals).  Nor am I advocating for violence.  Fair?  **I also hope that anyone who responds to this post reads it carefully and fully.  I say this because comments pushing at already-addressed points will appear as weak to my intuition and will be less likely to instill change.**\n\nSo I likely have either Narcissistic Personality Disorder or otherwise significant subclinical narcissistic personality traits.  Not diagnosed but seeking formal diagnosis.  I suffer from bouts of extreme hatred.  I discuss these with my therapist, but I kinda' would like to have them dissected in greater philosophical detail than can be found within a medical office.\n\nAnyway I have rather extreme views about what \"justice\" is.  Namely my views are largely genocidal, calling for people with Cluster B and C personality disorders, as well as other harmful psychological traits such as paedophilia / hebephilia / ephebophila, anti-vax views, tendencies to be sucked into harmful cults, etc., to just be rounded up and gassed.  Throw animal and child abusers in there too.  I don't feel empathy or remorse for such p... well, I don't view them as \"people\" either.  They're play things to me.  Toys for hard labor or just entertainment.  I've entirely dehumanized them.  This is the case *even while* I understand that people are shaped by their experiences and other factors they don't control.\n\nNow let me be very clear once again:  I am **not** endorsing my views.  But they are my sincerely-held views and much of the time I consciously believe in them.  And yes, I'm aware that gassing people with Cluster B PDs would include myself.  I will also be very clear that no I do **not** have self harm ideation.  I see it as a game of numbers:  harming myself does nothing and harms people I care about.  But a large-scale genocide makes people like me a non-factor and actually would solve many social ills... or so my thinking goes.  Put it this way:  if I were hypothetically given a position of total political power, I would definitely abuse that power to wipe human population down to a 4, maybe 5-digit number.  Why so low?  Didn't I just specify that my hate specifically targets specific clusters of people?  Well because my definitions of things like harmful cults, child abuse, and animal abuse are *very* encompassing.  Throw in climate deniers and anti-vaxxers and you've got a recipe for the near-extinction of humanity.  I sympathize with the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement.\n\nI am aware that my views are, shall we say, unpopular.  But I don't want to deny them \"merely\" because everyone else thinks they're wrong.  I'd feel insincere.  Rather, if I'm going to change my views, I'd rather do so wholeheartedly and be able to explain why the old views were wrong in detail.\n\nI've been able to partially convince myself that I'm wrong using a few lines of reasoning.  The first is that the process of genocide would likely make *more* traumatized people in the process, which would in turn make more people be predisposed to narcissism, cultlike behaviour, conspiratorial thinking, and so on.  Next, many factors for these problems are at least epigenetic, sometimes outright genetic.  So they won't go away via extermination attempts, especially the epigenetic ones since they're much harder to pin down and track.  Next, it doesn't *really* solve any problem because you can always say that some time in the future the problem, even if \"solved\" now will re-emerge.  As a matter of principle we may take this argument to the extreme: either the problems will re-emerge within humans, or whatever species comes next after us, or on some other planet.  You could eradicate social ills from the entire galaxy and still wonder about invasion from the next galaxy over.  Next I have another (granted extravagant and idiosyncratic) argument.  I see that merely investing in transhumanism and space travel would be a better utilization of the resources which would be spent on genocide.  Narcissism and other such issues cease to be an issue if the next physical individual is two light-years away and, like current social media, you have the ability to block users.  No physical harm of one person to another, and the ability to block out verbal harms.  Lastly is a Buddhist answer:  violence, anger, and aversion all stem from a wrong understanding of the self.  The concept of an intrasient, unconditioned self is illusory, and so any actions pursuant to that are based in delusion.  Violence is a manifestation of anger, a mental poison.  Hatred is addictive and violence releases dopamine, but neither resolves the problem of the cycle of coming and going, and discontentment or dukkha as a result of attachment to transient things.\n\nBut all these arguments have holes in them which my anger exploits.  Trying to heal or educate people out of these maladies is far too taxing on an already overburdened medical system.  Society still exists for the unenlightened.  Current advances in care for PDs and paedophiles and cult members have certain levels of success but are far from actually fixing anything.  We still see rampant misinformation everywhere and tonnes of people being sucked in, far more than can be easily taken back out.  Child abuse and malicious forms of parenting are so commonplace that while we fight spanking and telling children that they shouldn't have been born, we are forced to overlook other clearly injurious practices like fat shaming and less-obvious forms of Munchausen by Proxy (cases where for example the parent doctor shops until they get a \"legitimate\" diagnosis of *something* without any actual tampering of evidence or outright lying).  Technological advances to help in these matters is very far away.\n\nI know that I have a \"right\" to be upset by these things, but that means little to me.  I have a \"right\" to spread awareness and help support groups, but as I said above that doesn't even come close to enough.  And I know that I'll be asked \"well who draws the line?\"  My response is I don't care, we'll take a bunch of universally-hated traits and just roll with it.  And I know that things like psychiatric diagnoses can be varied and that different diagnosticians will give different diagnoses due to varying philosophies and experience.  I also don't care because a billion false positives leading to executions is better than even one false negative.  I have no empathy in this case, so appealing to my sense of empathy won't work.\n\nI'm a deeply religious person and I abhor violence.  Ironically I'm a Bah\u00e1'\u00ed (we are actively persecuted in many countries but particularly \u00cdr\u00e1n).  And even more profoundly ironically I'm Jewish by matrilinial birth and lost family in the holocaust.  But... neither of those things factors into my thinking.  Antisemitic and anti-Bah\u00e1'\u00ed views are largely based in dumb beliefs.  Hitler espoused all sort of conspiratorial and unscientific drivel that got him recognized early by the scientific community as a lunatic.  North Korea's Juch\u00e9 and Korean supremacist thought is also almost entirely bunk.  Same with other racial supremacy theories such as black supremacy and white supremacy.  Race is a social construct that has no physical basis in reality, and ethnicity is only slightly better-defined.  Cultures, gender, and other things are very fluid.  Eugenics is also bunk because the idea of, for example, a deaf race or other disability \"harming the gene pool\" just doesn't numerically add up.  Neurotypicality is also just an idealized model.  My anti-Personality Disorder views are certainly in the eugenics genre, but things like NPD, ASPD, and BPD can actually correlate with having a lot of children, who in turn are also likely to have predispositions towards at least many types of maladaptive behaviour as well as genetic predispositions tomards various PDs.  On top of this, the upper echelons of business and politics also often have higher rates of personality disordered individuals, and while this doesn't account for the vast majority of PD individuals, it means that social power is more likely to be influenced significantly by personality disordered people.  This is also true when discussing things like familial social hierarchies and more local social groupings.  Beyond the medical side of the PDs, looking at non-clinical things like consipiratorial thinking, harmful cultlike behaviour, purchasing of meat from an extremely abusive meat industry while intentionally and consciously turning a blind eye to it, and authoritarian parenting makes me much more sympathetic to my genocidal views.\n\nSo...... why am I wrong?  I mean it, prove me wrong.  And not in the internet provocateur \"prove me wrong\" manner, either.  I actually *want* to be shown how ill-conceived my views are.  I should also note that any responses I receive will likely get pushback from me in \"support\" of my current maladaptive views.  This isn't me being argumentative or unwilling to change.  I use arguments in favour of my own views in order to push them until they break.  It's a method of learning.  My thoughts are sincere, so they won't go down without a fight.", "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/p3ouuf/legitimate_question_why_are_my_opinions_garbage/", "id": "p3ouuf", "author": "LilamJazeefa", "link_flair_text": "Question", "num_comments": 97, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628872828.0, "comments": [{"author": "Muroid", "id": "h8t0bg9", "score": 10, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #128", "submission": "p3ouuf", "stickied": false, "body": "So... you\u2019re saying that you wish you lived in a world where you are going to be rounded up and gassed?", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628875111.0, "parent_id": "t3_p3ouuf", "replies": [{"author": "gerkletoss", "id": "h8ua9us", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #291 | Ordo Cognitus", "submission": "p3ouuf", "stickied": false, "body": "That's how I read it.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628893603.0, "parent_id": "t1_h8t0bg9", "replies": []}, {"author": "LilamJazeefa", "id": "h8t10rh", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #102", "submission": "p3ouuf", "stickied": false, "body": "Basically, the way my mind puts it is that \"the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or one.\"  If I knew that systematically eradicating people like me was the answer, I would not feel sorrow or self-pity.\n\nNow, I can see clearly that such a drastical policy is, erm, unlikely.

The closest scenario to that that I can imagine is if all of the people I see as contributing to these problems just died.\u201d\n\nThe problems with this are manifold. To start with, who should die depends heavily on whose perspective on what an ideal world would look like.

It does feel like this in many ways.  However, I don't see this as being 100% parallel to previous genocidal actions.  Usually the victims of genocide are othered groups and the reasoning for the blame being put on them is entirely threadbare.  In the case of thu groups I've outlined, it's by definition groups that have been causally correlated to distinct harms which have multi-generational impacts.  Furthermore, it's not an \"othered\" group.  I'm a narcissist, or at least significantly partially so.  I've come *way* too close to acting on paedophilia / ephebophila (fortunately I haven't actually).  I've been roped into cults.

I don't feel empathy or remorse for such p... well, I don't view them as \"people\" either.\n\nBecause if we can't help people overcome these disorders and allow them to still be functioning members of society, why wouldn't we do that?  I'm not going to defend abusing children sexually, but some pedophiles don't take action on those thoughts they have.  If someone is attracted to children and they never abuse a child, what does it matter?  As long as that person recognizes that they shouldn't act on their impulses to have sex with children then I see no problem with them hanging around.

You assume everyone is equally far gone, rather than operating on a spectrum.  Some people are worse off than others for their disorders.  Some could leave perfectly normal lives but still have the disorder.  And 2.) you have completely disregarded the redemption arc.

I'm not that familiar with the maximum capacity of the US's mental health treatment.  I will accept that our current *culture* towards mental health is pretty crap, but I haven't seen anything to suggest that the medical establishment is falling behind on it such that they're overrun with mental health patients.\n\nBut also it seems like you don't think that we could ever change or expand or improve that medical capacity.  Why?  Even if it was the case that we don't have the ability to help everyone all at once why is it the case that we couldn't just improve the system to acceptable levels?\n\nAnd finally, this doesn't need to be a save everyone or kill everyone position.

It's such a profound disconnect from standard morality that the sparing of a few people almost looks like semantics.\n\nWell I'm not suggesting we help a few people and gas the rest.  I'm suggesting we help who ever we can, and those who we cannot help we still try to.  Those we cannot help are still valuable to us at the very least by providing us real live examples to explore and test other kinds of treatment on.  If they're convicted child sex offenders, if they don't regret what they've done, and they don't want to help treatments, then maybe we could start talking about the death penalty.  I'd rather we exhaust other options first though.\n\n>Putting people on a spectrum of ability to be redeemed still has to acknowledge\n\nI was talking more about putting them on the spectrum of how much their mental health affects them.  How severely they are affected by these thoughts.  Couldn't it be the case that if they had proper training and education they could have learned to avoid acting on these thoughts?  Is that really *their* failure that they weren't taught that at a proper age?  Couldn't it be the case that these people experienced some kind of trauma in their life that made their other mental health concerns that much worse?  For some, redemption might seem far away but isn't and we'd never know that if we gassed them.\n\n>Putting people on a spectrum of ability to be redeemed still has to acknowledge (as I can tell you first hand) that most kiddie diddlers and social manipulators don't seek redemption and if offered won't even try.\n\nI'm really interested in how you've come across this conclusion as well.  Are you suggesting you've met *most* kiddie diddlers and social manipulators and that you have the psychological education required to adequately evaluate them?  It just seems to me like you're very eager to make a lot of really broad assumptions here and you're willing to condemn yourself and others to death based on those unproven assumptions alone.\n\nI'm in no way trying to sound hostile or anything here, nor am I a psychologist but is it possible that you're going through some self-deprecation of a sort and are projecting qualities you see in yourself that you don't like onto others that are similar to you?\n\n>Rehabilitation-style prison systems like what is seen in Europe can only rehabilitate so far. Even the best current methods to treat paeophilia, harmful cult brainwashing, personality disorders, and so on are still in their infancy and cannot properly address the volume we're talking about.\n\nSo this means we should stop trying?  Doesn't this actually mean we should keep trying and improve our methods?\n\n>So uh.... we gassing people 'r nah?

And even those of us who have religious and/or moral objections to violence nevertheless have violent thoughts or want to use violence to solve problems. It\u2019s just a human fantasy that we have because of indignation against unfair actions by corrupt people. I definitely know what you\u2019re talking about. I because I experience it too sometimes. We all do. \n\nI think there may be a different way of looking at this. Over the last century, and especially in the recent past, we\u2019ve started to see that sometimes overt force, coercion, and changing laws don\u2019t resolve some problems that run deep in society. For example, Prohibition in the United States in the 1930s absolutely didn\u2019t solve problems with alcohol, and in fact made things worse in some ways while it was in effect. In the past, people thought they could just impose laws and regulate behavior and it would fix everything, but it didn\u2019t and it can\u2019t. So the alternative many people immediately think of is what you\u2019re proposing here\u2014it\u2019s extreme, but it\u2019s the easiest solution that comes to mind because we understand violence and death. \n\nHowever, I think we may be able to use a different approach. I think that what you want isn\u2019t actually the mass execution of people who are in some cases objectively bad and wrong; what you want is a better system where it\u2019s less likely or even near-impossible for such people to be tolerated by society. I think that rather than legal change or violence, social change is what\u2019s necessary to improve things. Look at smoking in the United States: 20 years ago, people smoked all over the place, but through media campaigns and social pressure, tobacco smoking is now seen as much less acceptable and is often disparaged, other than in places where it\u2019s culturally so entrenched that it\u2019ll likely never die out. (Of course, now vaping is the new trend, but that\u2019s due to tobacco companies switching gears to something that seems more palatable to the public\u2014that\u2019s a corporate problem rather than a societal one.) If we can make such a huge difference in a relatively short time through social change in one respect, it should be possible to apply the same technique to other issues. The difficulty is in getting enough people to band together for a movement to gain traction, but once the Baby Boomers die out and Gen X and the Millennials rise to positions of power, I think society may be more amenable to change.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628880496.0, "parent_id": "t3_p3ouuf", "replies": []}, {"author": "usernames_suck_ok", "id": "h8t2y9l", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #233", "submission": "p3ouuf", "stickied": false, "body": "Admittedly without reading this word for word, I would quite honestly say you do something that pretty much everyone does in some way but never or rarely admits because they don't want to deal with the backlash or be perceived as a horrible person. Basically, I'm saying having extremely unacceptable views is not abnormal at all. There are groups of people I sometimes think should be rounded up and killed or sent off to another country, and that the world would be a better off if we got rid of those people. I don't think you and I are the only people who think this, and I don't think it automatically means someone has a mental illness if they do think like this. **If you act on it, there's something wrong with you.** \n\nThe interesting thing is we've seen people act on this. Concentration camps in the 1940s, American Indians/Indigenous people, and now you essentially have people acting on this with \"illegal\" Hispanic immigrants. Maybe not exactly like what you're saying, but very close--let's take people we don't approve of and put them somewhere in terrible conditions, make them do crazy things, abuse them, not give them the medical care they need, try to send them somewhere else, etc. Most of the examples are history, but with modern-day examples of this you see a lot of people standing by and letting it happen, and then you see other people who agree with what is being done. This should tell you a lot. \n\nI believe the only reason people believe thinking xyz way is wrong is because that's what we're told. I would say that, unfortunately, it's actually human nature, but that people don't want to accept that it's human nature because they can't face the idea that we're all just shit. I mean, for everyone who thinks we should only round up the \"morally bad people,\" there's someone who thinks bad people are people they just don't agree with or people who are a different race/ethnicity from them, and that's where you run into problems. You allow/tolerate one group of people to round up pedophiles and justify it, then we're all in danger of being victims of being rounded up and killed or shipped off. That would lead to the end of the world, i.e. we all kill each other, and maybe that will actually be what happens as to how the world ends--who knows. Trust me, the groups of people I tend to think we'd be better off getting rid of, except for violent people, are people who make up more than 50% of the population when you put them together, and I'd get ***major*** shit for saying society would be better off without these people.

It's not about deciding who's worthy unilaterally, it's accepting huge quantities of collateral damage if the end result makes the problems of the world manageable without overheating our social services.  Imagine if we actually took corrective action in every case of parents who knowingly engage in behaviours which are clear-cut abuse and who refuse to stop ewen when told of the harms.  We'll even allow the cases which aren't clear-cut to go free.  But we'll act in all of the cases of the spanking, fat shaming, telling children they should never have been born, subtle Munchausen by Proxy as I outlined above, and so on.  The easy stuff.  If we implemented such a policy and thoroughly enforced it..... there'd be an instantaneous orphan crisis.  So many parents would quadruple-down on their abusive practices and then play the victim when their kids got taken away since they refused to stop their clear abuse.  This is why we don't see social services swooping in to save nearly as many children as they theoretically could.  So.... the clear answer to the hoxic part of my mind is to just gas all the families of this type, including the children.  Save the children from orphanhood and stave off an orphan crisis, while removing from society a class of people who couldn't care less.  Those who survive will be hbe exemplars, and can be further pruned if there's any recidivism or new abuse.

You could just keep going and having mandatory screenings for young people once you had already wiped out all the pre-existing miscreants.  Like continuing to pluck small weeds after having torn out a big ivy plant suffocating your garden.\n\nAnd as for why I care about social ills while I have such a disconnect from empathy?  That.... is a good question.  I'm not entirely sure I can respond clearly.  It seems I have some form of empathy, but it's very conditional.  Knowing many other narcissistic and antisocial people, I can say that we do unually have at least some empathy, some care for others.  It's just... limited and twisted.  So we can look at a puppy being drowned and either wince or not depending the person (usually wince because it's what we're expected to do), but look upon the torture of people we don't like and not wince at all (unless it's socially advantageous to do so).  At least in my experience, we tend to think of people in very black and white terms. Shades of grey are there, but when it comes down to the brass tacks we'll throw anyone under the bus if we feel a need.  But otherwise we do actually care about social ills.  Someone who drowns a puppy still earns our anger.\n\nThis is exactly why I want to get better.  I can see in myself this exact \"partial empathy\" and can clearly see how it leads to all the other emotional ills of being a narcissist.  It frightens me so.

Hence why I'm asking this question, and why I don't mind the strong responses (apart from the people just calling me a monster -- they are doing way more damage than they know).\n\nProviding me with a logical toolbox which either will help instill an intuition of full empathy or at least skirt around the fact that I don't have one is, I feel, possible.

Then went to the photo feed bit. A disturbing clip involving a woman & a dog appeared & seared itself into my mind. I did a spew face emoji to it & tried to forget it. I couldn\u2019t smoke fast enough. Put the iPad down. I tried to comprehend what people would involve themselves in the production of such a clip or movie. Imagining how the camera man had started his day. A cold rage grew & intensified. I ate way too much weed! Tried to chemically restrain myself before I imagined seeing the world from the woman in the clips eyes. Was blending it & making weed milkshakes. The active ingredients in weed will bond with milk or butter, so be digested easier. Unfortunately it didn\u2019t kick in quickly enough. I felt a intense pure plasma hatred for the camera man. Took several days to work out what had happened. Cried big belly tears & roared with futile rage. Next morning I could barely move. I kinda crawled,swam my way along the floor to get to the toilet. Savage munchies but unable to get the food from the kitchen. Day 2 I could crawl. Ate dry multigrain pumpkin seed bread on the kitchen floor for breakfast & again at dinner. Day 3 I could walk again. I realised what had happened was that I had felt intense anger,hatred & frustration. All hatred was focused on the camera man. I then began to find flaws in my logic. How do I know it wasn\u2019t a woman holding the camera? Still the rage was there. I then did some thought experiments that had disturbing results. If I knew where everyone involved in the production of the traumatic clip I seen was shooting their next movie & I was in the military. How many innocent people could I accept as collateral damage if I knew I could get them? Drop a nuke on a town of 5k? 10k?, 15k? At 20k intoxicated with irrational hatred & rage me,  began to balk. My responses were genetically & culturally programmed into me. Like the \u201cBirkenhead drill\u201d. My tears were from frustrated rage that I was unable to get to the camera man. Took a few days to realise that. I write on a notebook any negative thoughts or questions. Vent the poison. I then change seats & respond on a different notebook from the perspective of a former colleague I admire. Change seats again & respond from another perspective. The process itself is cathartic. Use music to vent some rage, slowly select more positive songs to manipulate your mood. Careful when hunting monsters that you yourself don\u2019t become a monster. Quoting someone there. Best to find a way to process your anger. If you judge others & a mob forms. In time they would turn on you. Often deafness is coupled with dumbness. This doesn\u2019t mean that they are not intelligent. With hearing aids they can learn to speak. You referring to someone\u2019s beliefs as dumb leaves you vulnerable to criticism. I haven\u2019t heard the utilisation of the word dumb in this context as hate speech yet. You calling anything dumb could offend a deaf person or even someone that knows a deaf person. I am not offended or judging you. Just offering counsel. Tribalism is normal. It exists in every city. There will be a north v south or east v west rivalry. In mini simulated wars (football) between 2 teams we celebrate this rivalry and call it a derby. The rugby scrum is a simulated shield wall push.
