Solving methods have names, or at least descriptions.  Like maybe it will entail being asked, \"How would you solve this quadratic equation?\" and then you will say something like \"I would attempt to factor it\", because you will have learned to factor quadratic equations.\n\nThis may sound weird, but one of the problems people, even very smart people, have in learning highly abstract things like math is that they are so focused on the \"how to do\" they don't pick up on the \"what's it called\".  I certainly had that problem until well into my early 20s when I finally realized how important and powerful it was to know the names for things, and I've met plenty of people who had it too.  If you know the formal names for things, you can talk about them, Google them, look them up in books using the index, etc.  So making a point of learning the names for the things you will learn to do in math class will make you much more able to answer questions about them when called on.

All good stuff for answering difficult math questions!\n\nYou can embrace that experience, and surf that high.  Physically, exhilaration and terror feel the same: you get to pick which one you want to be experiencing by how you construe what's happening.  Sure, you'll be scared of doing poorly, but if you recognize these physical sensations of the adrenaline rush for what it is \u2013 your body unlocking something not unlike a superpower, giving your mind overdrive speed and sharpness \u2013 you can see it as a kind of rescue, the cavalry your body is sending to get you out of trouble, and turn a bad situation into a great one.\n\nJust remember, when your heart races and things seem to be going whoosh, that's because time is slowing down around you, because you're now moving super-fast.  *Take your time.* Slow down, and take your sweet damn time with whatever you've been asked to do.  Because you have *way* more time than you think you do in that state.  Your blood may be zinging and your heart pounding, but don't let that fluster you into a false sense of urgency, that's just what overdrive feels like.\n\nPeople who learn to ride this and make it their own, and use this power for additional cognitive boost, get *very* good at tests.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628055013.0, "parent_id": "t1_h7mxrx6", "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"author": "notdeepee", "id": "h7ii4qo", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #80 | Legio Virtus", "submission": "owix0p", "stickied": false, "body": "Consider this, you would definitely need the communication skills in an active workfield, so you should start practicing now.

I've done rather a lot of rather higher-stakes versions of this, from both sides (it's a standard and essential part of graduate studies, and is used in undergraduate admissions for universities like Cambridge), so here's some advice (assuming you haven't already done the exam):\n\n1. The whole point of an oral exam is that it is adaptive: you can adjust the difficulty of the questions and the level of support available as required. In particular: if all of the questions are hard, that means that you are doing *well*, and the percentage of questions that you are able to solve is not important. Typically, questions will scale up/down to find the boundary between the questions which you can solve and those which you cannot. I left my doctoral viva and went and cried in a corner while they were discussing, then passed comfortably. People who get into Cambridge to study mathematics are roughly an even split between people who thought that the interview went well, and people who thought it was a complete disaster. \n2. There's no hurry. These exams are not there to test your ability to answer questions quickly. Slow it down, take your time, and explain your thought process. Typically, being able to explain a good point to start from will typically result in being given prompts to help you, and being able to work through the problem with those hints will obtain a large portion of the credit. You don't need to be able to immediately solve every problem. Just explaining whatever thoughts you have is a good start.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628122745.0, "parent_id": "t3_owix0p", "replies": []}, {"author": "caparisme", "id": "h7iiwsm", "score": 0, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "", "submission": "owix0p", "stickied": false, "body": "You can't do it.
