Note I say you have \u201cthe opportunity\u201d because not everyone actually DOES learn from their experience, and certainly there are some I haven\u2019t.  I guess we all have mistakes we just keep making.\n\nBut one thing I feel like I\u2019ve learned is how to listen.  When I was younger I was good at listening for facts; I\u2019ll chalk that up to 18 years of school.  Them SS I matured I learned to listen past facts and listen to feelings.  Not what a person said, but how they were feeling when they said it.\n\nNow at 50 I\u2019ve found a new thing to listen for; values.  It\u2019s harder to tweak out because people don\u2019t necessarily say explicitly what they value.  But it\u2019s worth trying because our values say so much about who we are and what matters to us.  I\u2019m still learning to do it; got a long way to go yet.  But it\u2019s worth trying I think, as a way to really connect and understand the people you talk to.\n\nJust thought this might be worth a share!", "score": 14, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/pixt4s/learning_to_listen/", "id": "pixt4s", "author": "armyprof", "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "num_comments": 6, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630928543.0, "comments": [{"author": "Chimples10", "id": "hbst84r", "score": 5, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Initiate", "submission": "pixt4s", "stickied": false, "body": "Listening with the intent to understand rather than the intent to respond is priceless.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630930299.0, "parent_id": "t3_pixt4s", "replies": [{"author": "-Nullius_in_verba-", "id": "hbu3tnq", "score": 4, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #212", "submission": "pixt4s", "stickied": false, "body": "It really makes for a much better conversation.

The easiest and most worthless accomplishment is to get the other party to \"Yes.\" People will say \"Yes\" to anything just to shut you up.
