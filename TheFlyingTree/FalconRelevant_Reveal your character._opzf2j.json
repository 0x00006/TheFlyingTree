With the while world behind the cause, replacing fossil fuels with solar, wind, hydropower, and a little bit of nuclear to shore up the gaps, it should be possible to eliminate nearly all fossil fuels in a few decades. Accompanied by a switch to public transportation and electric cars, this would leave planes and ships as the major carbon emitters, which can hopefully be replaced by electric versions.\n\nAfter having bought some time on climate change, I would work on eliminating wealth inequality.

Hopefully this could be done within my lifetime. At the same time as this is going on, I would direct as much money as possible into researching interstellar travel and mind-uploading for immorality.
