{"title": "Prevalence of Reddit users with username: [Adjective]-[Noun]-[2-4 Numbers]", "name": "t3_owe5d8", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/owe5d8/prevalence_of_reddit_users_with_username/", "selftext": "This has been on my mind for a while and I\u2019m not sure whether I\u2019m just seeing a pattern that isn\u2019t there or if others have noticed the same.\n\nOver the past few months, perhaps close to a year, I feel like I have been noticing a lot of usernames that follow the general format in the title. I am wondering if they come from some sort of random username generator because it seems unlikely to me that someone would choose one like that. For example, the last one I saw a minute ago was something like \u201cNatural-Sun-3826\u201d, which just doesn\u2019t strike me as a user name someone would choose. It strikes me as randomly chosen words and numbers.  Running with that, my mind comes up with two likely scenarios: \n\n(A) They are real people that are making their usernames based on suggested ones from an algorithm.\n\n(B) They are bot accounts.\n\nMy questions to you all are:\n\n(1) Have you noticed this?\n\n(2) If you have, what do you think about the origin of these users?\n\n(3) I also know there are some users in this group whose usernames follow this pattern. How did you choose your username?\n\nEdited to add: I tried to make a new account just now to see if there is a suggested username feature that could explain this and there was not, however I only tried the option to make an account with an email address and not the Google/Apple options.", "score": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/owe5d8/prevalence_of_reddit_users_with_username/", "id": "owe5d8", "author": "PalatableNourishment", "link_flair_text": "Question", "num_comments": 35, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1627909669.0, "comments": [{"author": "Arjun_Dhama", "id": "h7femkf", "score": 12, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "", "submission": "owe5d8", "stickied": false, "body": "They are just picking up the usernames reddit reccomends them at the time of account creation", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1627911494.0, "parent_id": "t3_owe5d8", "replies": [{"author": "El_Duque_Caradura", "id": "h7fqu3b", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #296", "submission": "owe5d8", "stickied": false, "body": "I don't know about you, but I'm proud of the nickname I made up (El Duque Caradura stands for \"The Shameless Duke\" but in spanish)", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1627917271.0, "parent_id": "t1_h7femkf", "replies": [{"author": "Zumokamo350", "id": "h7fr76j", "score": 3, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #287", "submission": "owe5d8", "stickied": false, "body": "Muy bien!", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1627917437.0, "parent_id": "t1_h7fqu3b", "replies": []}, {"author": "theascendedcarrot", "id": "h7g322h", "score": 3, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #108", "submission": "owe5d8", "stickied": false, "body": "I am a redhead, but far more capable than your run-of-the-mill vegetable.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1627922575.0, "parent_id": "t1_h7fqu3b", "replies": []}]}]}, {"author": "Zealousideal_Mix_629", "id": "h7fdrqp", "score": 8, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #13 | Legio Virtus", "submission": "owe5d8", "stickied": false, "body": "Mine was a suggested name, didn't care enough to change it.
