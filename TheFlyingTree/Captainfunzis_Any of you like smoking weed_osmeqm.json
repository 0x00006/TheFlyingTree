Caffeine absolutely affects your processing and response and it\u2019s debated whether it\u2019s a euphoriant. It is easily addictive and a rather large fraction of the US with experience physical withdrawal within half a day if we cut off their coffee and soda supply. Caffeine can stimulate anxiety and sleep deprivation, which I would consider a form of functional inhibition.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to argue that caffeine is evil and needs to be regulated, nor that you should feel bad if you use it, just that a lot of our division between what we consider good and normal and bad and brain altering is sort of arbitrary. Alcohol causes these negative aspects to a much greater degree than weed but because alcohol was ingrained into social norms way earlier (it was the only potable form of water in some cultures for a long time, before they realized the boiling was the key) it hasn\u2019t been nearly as stigmatized", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1627444532.0, "parent_id": "t1_h6sgmks", "replies": [{"author": "caparisme", "id": "h6snrta", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "", "submission": "osmeqm", "stickied": false, "body": "Yeah but does caffeine impairs your ability to function the way weed high can do every time? Absolutely not. Sure some experience very mild withdrawal but emphasis on mild. Sure if you have anxiety don't overdo it but it doesn't affect most mentally healthy consumers. The key word is \"can\". It's possible but not a primary effect one would expect to get when consuming them. The high of other psychoactives however are the main reason for their consumption. Coffee just doesn't compare. People mostly gets addicted to coffee the same way they're 'addicted' to good tasting food. They'll be a bit bummed of they can't have any but they'll pretty quickly walk it off and forget about it. Overdose is practically nonexistent.\n\nI agree that alcohol is a more similar comparison. It does everything a psychoactive drug does. Maybe it's not stigmatized where you're at but some major religions have quite a beef with them and they ends up prohibited in a lot of cultures and societies as a result. Even where it's not, drunks and alcoholics are still looked down upon. Some more than the others due to DUI related deaths or domestic abuse. Maybe not directly outlawed but the stigma is still there.\n\nI think it boils down to practicality. Just because things are classified the same way ought to mean they should be treated the same way. In the end we weight the pros and cons case by case and it's easy to see why caffeine is treated differently to the more potent drugs. Alcohol on the other hand *is* a little bit more interesting since it's ingrained culturally and even economically. It doubles as a beverage which still have some nourishing purpose even if not consumed to the point of inebriation. Like coffee, even without the effects they're still enjoyable for the taste alone. And i guess its been around for so long it's feels more familiar and understood so regulating it is easier than drugs. Psychoactives mainly originate from medicine, a fairly less accessible field with a more stringent standard and manufacturing procedure. Abuse oftentimes leads to immediate and direct fatalities. You can't overdose on coffee. Alcohol might give you liver failure after many years of addiction. So there's both means and reason to clamp down on drugs.

The amount of people who i know drinks coffee and have no issues with things like sleep disruption. Too many people consumes it globally and if it's a real issue it should be noticeable long ago.\n\n>I'm pretty sure most people who drink coffee regularly agree that it makes them feel good and it's beyond just making them more awake/alert.

It barely even helps stave off sleepiness so I drink them purely for the taste. I can be quite a heavy drinker when they're available but when I'm off on trips where I don't have access to them I can easily go for weeks barely even noticing i haven't seen coffee for that long. I know some people are more sensitive to them but i've always thought of it as some kind of placebo/nocebo effect because sometimes the effect still persists even when they mistakenly (or by prank) took decaf. Coffee has been a mundane thing for as long as ive lived. Sure they're commonly prescribed when you need to stay up but it hardly works when you really need them to. But I've never seen anyone ever going like I GOT TO HAVE COFFEE RIGHT NOW OR I CAN'T FUNCTION. Not even in the cliche \"she's grumpy cuz she haven't had coffee\" sort of way. I have never heard anyone having headaches because they didn't have coffee my entire life. Maybe if they had too much but most of the time it's only because they've been repressing the need to have sleep among dealing with stressful workload. It might be a thing but it should either be really minor or infrequent else it would be a more noticeable thing considering how many people consumes them. I've been in academia multiple times as well as worked in crunch time working environments so i've seen my fair share as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Yeah, this is what I think the case is--it's just what's more normal in society (i.e. familiar)\n\nYeah i can only guess.
