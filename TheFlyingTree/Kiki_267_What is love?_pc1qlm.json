Love can be like the weather or an intentional response to the changing weather. Love as a value transforms pain into purpose. Life is hard. Relationships with people we love can be challenging. Difficult situations will trigger difficult thoughts and feelings. Can we still choose to act with love? Can we overcome mistakes with love? Love as a value is an ongoing commitment with no arrival. Love is an intentional choice to act lovingly or affectionately towards ourselves or others as life unfolds. Love is about the difficult decisions we make. Love is about what we choose to stand for and the actions we want to cultivate. Love often takes courage. Sometimes love looks like vulnerability, validation or creating space for others. Sometimes love is setting limits, assertiveness or prioritizing our needs.
