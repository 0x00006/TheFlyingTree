No idea how or why I made it here but I\u2019ll take it! \n\nI want to take a moment to discuss Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. I know the rules say no harassment so I will attempt to keep this rather level headed. I want to address why they should be looked up skeptically and deserve more public pressure and criticism. \n\nJWs are a religion that I feel is better described as a cult. I spent 23 years in it because I was born in it and I still live with active JWs. The rank and file members are constantly bombarded with anti LGBT propaganda, they are taught to refuse life saving blood transfusions for themselves, and they are highly encouraged to shun members who disagree with official doctrine but also those who leave the \u201corganization\u201d. Not only this, they are on the level with the Catholic Church in regards to how they cover up child sex abuse (see https://youtu.be/EmfyhQo8yNI). \n\nDo not get me wrong, the average JW comes across as nice and well meaning, and they usually are, but they are part of a toxic cult. Before engaging with one be sure to do your research about what they actually believe. Check out JWfacts.com for good info as well as r/exJW. \n\nAlso, do not be an asshole to JWs if they show up at your house. They believe they are the only ones god will save and everyone else is controlled by the devil, if you are hostile with them it will feed the idea they are hated because they are right. Instead try to engage in an actual conversation with them and tactfully challenge their ideas. If you don\u2019t want to do that then ask to be put on their \u201cDo Not Call\u201d list and they will leave you alone and will not come to your door.", "score": 15, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/pgxfy0/i_was_just_added_can_we_discuss_jehovahs/", "id": "pgxfy0", "author": "wondering-soul", "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "num_comments": 27, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630640981.0, "comments": [{"author": "neolthrowaway", "id": "hberdac", "score": 5, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #338", "submission": "pgxfy0", "stickied": false, "body": "Excuse me, do you have a moment to talk about our lord and savior?", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630644403.0, "parent_id": "t3_pgxfy0", "replies": [{"author": "wondering-soul", "id": "hbere30", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #539", "submission": "pgxfy0", "stickied": false, "body": "No", "is_submitter": true, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630644416.0, "parent_id": "t1_hberdac", "replies": [{"author": "neolthrowaway", "id": "hbero54", "score": 3, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #338", "submission": "pgxfy0", "stickied": false, "body": "This is so sad \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude2d\n\nAlexa play I am a child of God", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630644586.0, "parent_id": "t1_hbere30", "replies": [{"author": "gemini_pain", "id": "hbfldv5", "score": 3, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #43", "submission": "pgxfy0", "stickied": false, "body": "After that song I\u2019ll take \u201cOne is the loneliest number\u201d please!", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630667560.0, "parent_id": "t1_hbero54", "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"author": "timPerfect", "id": "hbf5mo1", "score": 4, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #414", "submission": "pgxfy0", "stickied": false, "body": "so ironic that those Jehovah's witnesses feel persecuted by others when their fantasy is everybody else to burn in hell for eternity", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630654539.0, "parent_id": "t3_pgxfy0", "replies": [{"author": "penguin_clubber", "id": "hbnf6cz", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #576", "submission": "pgxfy0", "stickied": false, "body": "They don't believe in hell", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630814700.0, "parent_id": "t1_hbf5mo1", "replies": [{"author": "timPerfect", "id": "hbnfk02", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #414", "submission": "pgxfy0", "stickied": false, "body": "Watch Tower publications teach that hell (hades or sheol) is not a place of fiery torment, but rather the \"common grave of mankind\", a place of unconscious non-existence.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630814931.0, "parent_id": "t1_hbnf6cz", "replies": [{"author": "timPerfect", "id": "hbnflij", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #414", "submission": "pgxfy0", "stickied": false, "body": "so yea schooled, thank you for correcting me", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630814958.0, "parent_id": "t1_hbnfk02", "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"author": "ennovyelechim", "id": "hbfjb9s", "score": 4, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #111", "submission": "pgxfy0", "stickied": false, "body": "I went to school with a couple of JWs truly lovely girls trying to navigate the world between home and heathens bless em. So I've never had a problem when they turned up at the door. I just told them I'm not likely to catch any religion from a door knock but they're welcome to meet my cat Lucifurr usually they can't get away fast enough at that point. Then I met Jeff who started work at my office, he told me he was on the path and was stunned when I knew what he was talking about. I knew about ' the path' but I didn't want to be on it. He was a bit of a bullying ass bit lots of people are so I didn't think much about it until my son came out as gay. I was discussing it with a gay colleague asking what I should or shouldn't do to make him feel accepted and Jeff pipes up that my 15 year old son was evil, dirty, disgusting and deserves to burn in the hell he was inevitably going to. I'm British we regard religion like we do private parts, if you've got one and your proud of it that's awesome just do not wave it in anyone's face. This tirade of hate that spewed from Jeff was horrendous the whole office heard and the whole office gave him what for at the same time. He slunk off into his corner into his righteous indignation where he stayed, no more chit chat from anyone. So personally, if you want to take any path you want crack on,  but do beware of where you spout hate because you might get a cumuppance. I don't even open the door to be polite to JWs anymore. I don't allow hate over my threshold. I'm sure there are truly lovely well meaning people there but I cannot and will not engage with people who would condemn a minor to hell because of their sexuality its screwed up on so many levels it's beyond funny.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630666087.0, "parent_id": "t3_pgxfy0", "replies": []}, {"author": "olyfilmgirl", "id": "hberucw", "score": 3, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #365", "submission": "pgxfy0", "stickied": false, "body": "My husband married into a JW family in the 90s.
