But this is one topic that I just need to know more about, because people's lives are on the line. Just a little while ago even, [Kabul airport bombs](https://www.wsj.com/articles/afghanistan-kabul-airport-explosion-11629976397) killed four United States marines and 60 Afghans.\n\nI used to be a hard noninterventionist and pacifist. But after studying America's foreign policy failures (such as with the Rwandan genocide), watching Myanmar get taken over by their own military, and reading Hitchens, I don't know anymore. I lean further from my old ideas by the day.\n\nRegardless of my thoughts, however, I feel as if I am not even qualified to hold an opinion on the Afghanistan conflict. The situation feels too convoluted for anyone to possess the one right answer (if a right answer even exists in the first place, which very well might not be the case).\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Afghanistan, whether the United States should stay, what the United States should've done differently, and what the world should do moving forward?", "score": 8, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/pc60fr/afghanistan_what_should_the_world_do/", "id": "pc60fr", "author": "jmcsquared", "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "num_comments": 37, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630004257.0, "comments": [{"author": "Alatain", "id": "hagsre7", "score": 17, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #31", "submission": "pc60fr", "stickied": false, "body": "I served there several years ago, and my opinion is that the culture of the people does not line up with what we were trying to do.

Switzerland is a fine example.  Modern, forward-thinking cantons lie side by side with insane, sexist, religious-reactionary cantons.  Every canton has its own language and religion, and none of them overlap very much.  Should sound familiar if you know anything about Afghanistan....\n\nAnd yet, while Switzerland has all kinds of problems, and these days we take a dim view of not letting women vote, their system is stable.  They chose it at a time in their history when, not unlike Afghanistan, they couldn't agree to form a single government and everything was on the brink of disaster with everyone at everyone else's throats.\n\nNot to put too fine a point on it:  they chose that system because there was *no way in hell* they could possibly form a stronger, more centralized government.\n\nIt's hard not to see Afghanistan in a similar light.  The US and its allies tried to establish a strong centralized power structure in a country that was bound to reject that idea.  Many of us said at the time, and kept saying it, and still say it to this day:  that was not going to work.  And it's clear it has not.\n\nWhat's even more ironic is that the US is not a very strongly centralized political system either.   The US is pretty highly anarchic compared to most industrial democracies.  (Not Switzerland but most others.)  So it's funny that the first thing that the American planners did in Afghanistan was try for this fantasy of highly centralized government power.  Washington DC seems to have that effect on people.  They forget how their own country even works.\n\nIf it had been up to me (heaven help us all....), I would have started with what Afghanistan already has -- a loose system of autonomous regional power.  As an invading military force, I would be bound by the conventions of international law to ensure border integrity and internal security *to a point*, but I would quickly move to socialize the idea that Afghanistan is going to look like its own thing, not like anyone else's fantasy of power.\n\nWithin the first 6 months or so, I would make it clear that continued intervention after the initial military phase is going to depend entirely on the provinces.  Each province can invite or refuse outside aid -- if they invite it, it comes with a promise of military support on our side and a promise of security on theirs.  That's one of the key points.  Security is their responsibility.  They don't have to form a national army, they can organize and fight \"their way\" instead of \"our way\" if that's what they want.   But they have to guarantee security in their own home.  If they can't or won't, then we leave, and that means everything -- troops, technical support, development support, cash payments, everything.  We will review any decision to return whenever we feel like getting around to it.\n\nIf that meant that by year 1 we were out of every province, then so be it.  We declare victory and announce that the people of Afghanistan have chosen their own destiny.  Yay.  Hooray.\n\nIf it meant staying in some parts of the country and letting the Taliban overrun others, then okay, that's what they want.  In a few hundred years maybe they'll be like Switzerland.\n\nWould it have worked?  I have no clue.  20 years later, my plan might have been mired in civil war, the return of the Taliban, and a power vacuum in Afghanistan that was rapidly being filled by pan-Islamic fundamentalist organizations.\n\nBut that wouldn't be any worse than today, or than 1990 for that matter.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630026525.0, "parent_id": "t3_pc60fr", "replies": []}, {"author": "ravenclaw1138", "id": "hai1e4n", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #27 | Classis Veritatus", "submission": "pc60fr", "stickied": false, "body": "One thing for sure we need to do is to stop funding the extremist groups and corrupt governments, that would help mitigate a lot of problems.

Blitz and bomb the ever loving shit out of it in the greatest show of power we could muster, and then let it fucking stew. There never should have been boots on the ground like there was, or as long as it was. For the same reason that we saw Iraq as a monstrous clusterfuck we shouldn't touch, we SHOULD have seen Afghanistan as that as well.   \n\n\nhowever, corporate greed got in the way. They saw the chance to renew the oil pipelines that several countries wanted to run through there (One of which Trump signed into existing as part of the deal with the Taliban, and should be online this year). They then saw the potential of the mining and mineral reserves there. Lithium. The corruption, overall, also saw the drugs (opium), and that caused a shit ton of problems because, well, greed and stupidity.   \n\n\nWhat should have been done differently, other than that brief war, would have been entering it as China enters unstructured, piss poor, undeveloped nations. They build roads, infrastructure, power grid, wells, all of it with loans and leases, so that the companies AND states that enter into agreements with them end up with a vested interest in making things better. The shit China's doing in some African nations is ASTOUNDING in it's level of success. Yes, it's expositive and bad, yes it's profit driven and it caters to dictators sometimes, HOWEVER, they're laying the groundwork when they do this to allow the societies themselves to advance economically out of tribal war cultures, and into states where a middle and working class WILL develop given some time. The way they do it, is a way that the locals feel like THEY created it, when all along it was just  as planned and structured as the chinese economy has been for decades.   \n\n\nSo, we should have done that. Tie projects to resources. Hey, we want 20% of your mining, and for that we'll go in and build 1000 miles of roads to the mines we want, AND put in an entire city water sewer plan and plot out homes/apartments for 50000 people. (that's the sort of shit china does). Hey, we'd love for you to have a strong internal defense force so that loonies cant attack the pipeline we'll pay you 400 million a year in royalties for--so, hop to it guys, money's on the line!  \n\n\nThat would have been something close to what should have been done. With SMALL, RARE,  interventions with military force. China does this with paid (bribed) local police and military. They make WAY WAY more working for china than they so some shit head with rusty AK's and a Koran fetish.   \n\n\nAnyway, i think a video would be educational. It's old, but it's relevant to this topic. Consider watching.   \n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3xlb6\\_0OEs", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630054914.0, "parent_id": "t3_pc60fr", "replies": []}, {"author": "DELETED", "id": "hagjyup", "score": -2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": null, "submission": "pc60fr", "stickied": false, "body": "[deleted]", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630004344.0, "parent_id": "t3_pc60fr", "replies": [{"author": "justausername22222", "id": "haglr2l", "score": 5, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #165", "submission": "pc60fr", "stickied": false, "body": "WMDs were  the justification for the war in Iraq.
