I pulled one of the conference room chairs from the trash heap, cleaned it as well as I could, and took it home. To this day, stained and torn in places, it's still the chair I sit at in my home office. I've since bought seven more, and I don't think I'm done yet.\n\nI can work for hours on end in these chairs. I can sleep a whole night in one. Everyone who sits in the guest chair in my office or at home tells me it's the most comfortable seat they've ever rested their cheeks upon. I would risk my life to get them all outside if my house ever burned down.
