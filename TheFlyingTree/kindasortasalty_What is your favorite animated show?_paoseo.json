Not saying they're better, interested in your opinions.\n\nI think Clone Wars was more consistently good/ improved over the first few seasons into something good. But all the droid and jar jar episodes were terrible to me.\n\nRebels was nice because it was a coherent story without jumping all over the timeline. Never really liked the animations for it (especially Yoda...). It never hit the highs that Clone Wars did but it also never dropped as low as those droid/jar jar episodes IMO.\n\nBad Batch was interesting. Nothing terrible so far, so the floor to me is higher than either of the other two, but also there hasn't been anything about it that really drew me in. Still, since there will be more seasons it has time to go either way but with their experience at this point I'm guessing it'll end ahead of Rebels at least, maybe Clone Wars too.\n\nAnywho, that's my general thoughts on the series.

There's nothing else that compares to Ahsoka/Maul/Ventriss. But I'm probably higher on Rebels than most people are.\n\nI think that Bad Batch is way better than I expected, in that I didn't think that was an interesting group of characters but the Universe they inherit is fascinating due to the upheaval caused by the Empire consolidating power in the aftermath of the Clone Wars.\n\nMy biggest problem with Clone Wars is that there were some really weak story lines. So you could end up wasting a lot of time if you don't pick and choose which arcs to follow.

Araki is a genius in my book.\n\nAfter that it\u2019s gotta be the Monogatari series. This show is so well written it actually makes me self conscious about my own writing efforts. Ive never seen a show that so consistently answers all the questions I have in regards to plot and characters. Something weird will happen and I\u2019ll wonder to myself why that happened and Araragi will come in and ask the same question. That\u2019s just a small reason that I think gets across the care that goes into every sentence of dialogue in this show.\n\nNow I understand that favorite is supposed to be a single show and I\u2019m getting away from that, but these 3 stand above everything else for me, so I can\u2019t answer my favorite without mentioning all of them. My third show is K-On!  This is the ultimate comfy show for anyone who wants to sit back relax and enjoy a stress free and heartwarming experience about a group of friends enjoying their time together. You get to watch these girls grow both as people and as friends, and their relationships have so much nuance in them that you can\u2019t help but appreciate how much they care for each other.\n\nThen just to stay in line with everyone else here. Avatar the Last Airbender is probably one of the best stories ever told. It\u2019s the perfect length with almost no bloat, and tells a complete story from start to finish, with undoubtedly some of the best character arcs ever put to screen. The action is engaging with power levels well established and understandable, so when a character pulls off a cool move you can appreciate it for being cool without wondering how the fuck they managed to do that. It also makes the stakes incredibly clear so we know when to worry about our characters and when to laugh along with them.
