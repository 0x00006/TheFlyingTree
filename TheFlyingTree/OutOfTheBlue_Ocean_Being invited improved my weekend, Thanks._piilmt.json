{"title": "Being invited improved my weekend, Thanks.", "name": "t3_piilmt", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/piilmt/being_invited_improved_my_weekend_thanks/", "selftext": "At the end of a rubbish week, or maybe just a rubbish day, I decide that- fuck it, let\u2019s be more active on Reddit, the place where no one truly cares about who I am nor what I say. After being addicted to Twitter for over a year and going clean over a night some months ago, coming back to talking without caring about who listens was quite a comfort. Twitter took a year of my life and filled it with nothing of value but the reassurance I gained is something I still miss on my worse days. Reddit was something I hopped on weekly, bi-weekly or even monthly just to check things out and to avoid the hot section from being too repetitive. It was just to cool off from the intensity on Twitter but still get to feel like I was a part of the world. Now, after deleting Twitter, Reddit has become more and more like my new escape. Reddit still feels safer. I don't feel as attached, as of yet. (though, I am still being cautious.)\n\nThis rubbish weekend takes a turn when I get the message that afternoon or evening, which I do not see until the next day, it reads: \u201cyou have been added as an approved member of /r/TheFlyingTree: The Flying Tree.\"\n\nAnd, honestly, I had no idea what I was looking at. But it made me a little happier. I suppose it\u2019s random of who is approved and who is not, so I'm likely not very special- but I felt special. Reading that message felt like I had done something right, even though I knew it was probably based on nothing. I've since decided to make an effort and attempt to stick around!\n\nFrom what I can understand this sub is just about posting anything as long as it is effortful and isn't breaking any guidelines\u2026? I write a lot in my free time and this would be great to practice getting over my creative block and so on. I hope to get a lot better and I won\u2019t if I don\u2019t find a way to motivate myself to practice, dropping something small here every week or so could be a way to motivate myself. So, that\u2019s the plan going forward. I also paint, and generally just think a lot- maybe I'll share some of that too.\n\nToday I had nothing good to share, I just wanted to say hi. Just wanted to get started, write my thoughts down and get over the stupid feeling that I'm not welcome when clearly that is up to me from now on. It made me happy to have been invited, this seems like a cool place :)", "score": 16, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/piilmt/being_invited_improved_my_weekend_thanks/", "id": "piilmt", "author": "OutOfTheBlue_Ocean", "link_flair_text": "Other", "num_comments": 12, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630867034.0, "comments": [{"author": "Wafflebot3500", "id": "hbpuesr", "score": 3, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #135", "submission": "piilmt", "stickied": false, "body": "Hi!
