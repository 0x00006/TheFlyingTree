Ill share my opinion real quick:\n\nPersonally, I'm for it. If we stopped incarcerating drug offenders and used that money instead on treatment and proper (not D.A.R.E) education programs, i beleive we could significantly reduce the drug problem we have in this country. Just look to Portugal to see what happens when drugs are decriminalization. Drug deaths plummeted.\n\nI will add in that I am biased. I like drugs, they interest me. I use psychadelics, smoke weed and enjoy kratom. Drink alcohol? None of this feel morally reprehensible to me. I don't use hard drugs, but I still beleive it shouldn't be a crime to do so, and wish we could help treat those who fall prey to addiction instead of locking them up. I beleive decriminalization is the best course of action. To me it seems logical but when I bring this up, most people look at me like I'm insane. \n\nAnyway, thats all I'm gonna say on this incredibly complex issue.

Something like Hamilton Morris' stance: maybe there should be restrictions on radioactive materials, but otherwise, open it up.\n\nOn top of that, I think we should go for a **licensing model**.  \nThink about cars. They are legal, but extremely dangerous. How do we handle those? You need a license to drive one, and you can get driver's education that includes in-car training. I think that's a smart approach.  \n(Naturally the specifics for car licenses are going to be different in different places, but the analogy holds)\n\nAdditionally, I think we should need a **specific, class-based license** for drugs. This is for harm-reduction purposes.   \nAgain, think about cars. if you have a license to drive a regular car, you are not automatically qualified to drive a motorcycle, an 18-wheeler transport truck, or a school-bus. The different vehicles are different enough that you need specialized skills and additional training, which gets tested and accredited with the additional license.  \n\nI think we should do the same for drugs. The default normal license would be for alcohol, cannabis, and nicotine. You could have that training in high-school and have people take the test to get the basic license in high-school. That would act as an introduction to the legal system of drug licenses and you're on your way.  \nYou want to take psychedelics? Great, take the test for the license. If you want help to get it, go to \"user's education\" to learn more about the substances, then take the test. Same with stimulants, same with opioids, same with everything.  \nThere could also probably be a \"level 2\" license for administering and overseeing other people on a substance. For example, you want to be a psychedelic \"guide\"? Okay, take the psychedelic \"level 2\" license so you can administer them to other people. I think mandatory training makes sense here since you become responsible for other people under your care. \n\nThere would also be an exception for prescriptions: if your doctors wants you to take antibiotics, you don't need the license because you're operating under the doctor's guidance, which would probably be some kind of \"level 3\" license where you can prescribe to others, but are overseen by the College of Physicians or whatever body. This could also provide a mechanism for Clinical Psychologists (PhD) to prescribe medication without working with a Psychiatrist (MD).\n\nAdditionally, having the government agency that oversees regular medication also oversee the safe manufacture and distribution of substances would be key (e.g. the FDA in the USA). That would make substances pure, and it would undercut illegal markets that sell drugs to fund criminal organizations' other operations, which also avoid taxes.  \nNaturally, some kind of \"decriminalize nature\" thing would apply here as well: you could grow cannabis, mushrooms, poppies, cacti, etc. without issue, and you could grow them with the purpose of consumption so long as you've got the appropriate license to consume.\n\n\n\nYes, this would be a government program rather than free reign. I know some people hate that idea. My thinking is that this provides the best **pragmatic** option, even if the idealist might argue for \"cognitive liberty\". I don't disagree exactly, but I'm also a pragmatist when it comes to policy ideas.  \nThis license solution would make substance use (i) vastly safer through purity, (ii) vastly safer through education, (iii) vastly more available because of wider markets, and would have additional benefits of (iv) providing tax revenue that could directly fund safe-injection sites and addiction/rehabilitation programs (like how Fish & Game tags directly fund Fish & Game conservation efforts), and (v) undercut the economic power or criminal organizations engaged in way worse things that \"selling drugs\".\n\nPlus, there should be a program of appeals started where non-violent drug-related crimes, especially simple possession but also trafficking etc., should be fast-tracked for review and release/pardon.  \nNot a blanket because I get that sometimes police forces catch a violent criminal on a lesser charge so you don't just want to release everyone at once. Still, people in prison for \"crimes\" that should not be crimes should get fast-tracked for review to be released with expungement of their records.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629264274.0, "parent_id": "t3_p6e27d", "replies": []}, {"author": "Arisdoodlesaurus", "id": "h9do363", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #102", "submission": "p6e27d", "stickied": false, "body": "All drugs should be de criminalized.

One can be addicted to virtually anything which relates to dopamine or serotonin release in brain. Running, internet, caffeine, driving, weed, psychedelics, hell even drinking juice for some people.

A person after one dose of heroin will undergo withdrawal symptoms and (in general) is already in need of rehab. This is precisely why the overuse of opiates in the US is taking such a dramatic toll on the population.\n\nOne cannot be psycho-chemically addicted to weed or psychodelics. It's a different mechanism. Don't get me wrong weed addiction is just as serious, however it is harder to acquire it. It requires regular, often habitual use of the substance and whether or not a person will actually end up addicted still strongly varies between individuals.\n\nNot every addiction is the same. People who become addicted to running still undergo mild withdrawal symptoms and what is more tend to run to the point its detrimental to their health (Chapman, de Castro; 1990). People who become addicted to weed or psychodelics run a higher risk of developing schizophrenia for example (Hjorthoj; 2021). But its not guaranteed that a user will become an addict. This is why I said that a cop has no authority to decide if someone should go to rehab. We don't put every person who enjoys the runner's high to rehab, and we shouldn't do that for people who use weed. For people who take strong opiates this option would be viable.
