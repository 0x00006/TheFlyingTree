But it requires that you not treat your population as a disposable workforce being paid an absolute minimum wage that the labor market will bear.  You have to ensure that everyone is going to get more than that.\n\nIt's a concept that is sometimes associated with the American industrialist Henry Ford, who hit on the idea of choosing to pay his many thousands of workers a much higher wage than the market rate, so that they could afford to buy the cars that he produced in his factories.  The idea is, if your workers can afford your goods, then you have created a new market for your goods.  The workers prosper more, you sell more cars, it is a pretty good deal.  Because of that association, it is sometimes called \"fordism.\"\n\nThe one thing it is bad at is creating or maintaining steep wealth differentials.  So if your goals are social control and lack of mobility, or if you measure success as having lots more money proportional to other people, who have very little compared to you... then you will not like these ideas of highly-paid workers or universal basic income.\n\nThe people who value those things are very good at packaging and marketing their message, so you will see a lot of people even on reddit who have been socially programmed to argue against anything that disrupts those goals, even if the arguments make no sense.  They don't have to make sense, they just have to generate lots of confusion and doubt, and drive you to passivity and apathy.
