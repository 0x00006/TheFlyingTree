For example I used to share bars of milka chocolate during lunch break at highschool with my friends and I ate some for the first time in ages the other day and I was taken right back! Also felt similar when I saw kellogs fruit winders on the shelf the other day (weirdest snack ever?) Hearing Busted music or Britney's early stuff and watching old Rugrats or Fairly Odd Parents episodes get me too. \n\nHow about you guys?", "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/p8sdcj/what_are_some_objectsfoodsongstelevision/", "id": "p8sdcj", "author": "Chocolate_effort", "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "num_comments": 13, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629555949.0, "comments": [{"author": "Cognizant_Psyche", "id": "h9slbsn", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #151 | Ordo Cognitus", "submission": "p8sdcj", "stickied": false, "body": "[This.](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/8/85/Return_of_the_jedi_speeder.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20060422214845)", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629557152.0, "parent_id": "t3_p8sdcj", "replies": [{"author": "Chocolate_effort", "id": "h9slth7", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #179", "submission": "p8sdcj", "stickied": false, "body": "Love it.
