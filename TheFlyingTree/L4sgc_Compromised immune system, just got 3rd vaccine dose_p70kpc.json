And unless it seems like a medical emergency I should only call my doctor if the symptoms last beyond the fifth day.\n\nAccording to the [German report](https://www.pei.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/newsroom/dossiers/sicherheitsberichte/sicherheitsbericht-27-12-bis-30-06-21.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=5) on vaccine safety from July seen side effects in their study after 75 million people being fully vaccinated were:\n\n\\~10% had a sore arm\n\n\\~8% were tired and/or have head aches\n\n8-10% got fiver\n\n4% got muscle pain and joint pain, flu like symptoms, dizziness\n\n3% got a general unwellness, nausea\n\nless than 2% got a rash, swollen lymph nodes, paraesthesia, tachycardia or dyspnoe.\n\nThere were 228 reports of perimyocarditis and myocarditis after an earlier vaccination (ie 1 in 328'947 or 0.000304%). Of these six men (ages 90, 80, 71, 59 and 56) and three women (ages 84, 67 and 64) have died (i.e. 1 in 8'333'333).\n\nThere were a total 157 people who died due to thrombosis after receiving AstraZeneca. Which translates to a 28.3% higher rate than for unvaccinated people (ie statistically they expected around 110-115 to die from thrombosis in the same time span, due to the background prevalence of thrombosis in the general population). After that, AZ was not given to anyone below the age of 60 without their explicit demand. And even for the elderly it was quickly phased out as other vaccines became available. For all other vaccines, the rates of thrombosis were not elevated. (i.e. they took this very seriously)\n\nThere have been a total of 135 reports of abnormal menstrual cycles (most of which returned to normal after one or two months according to a different study).\n\nThere have been 362 reports of allergic reactions.\n\nTable 11 (page 24) gives long list of diseases that might be triggered by the various vaccines and their background levels. Only two show (potentially) elevated levels: thrombozytopenie and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrom, both for AstraZeneca.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, yes, if you get vaccinated, there will be likely adverse reactions. Yes, some of them are even dangerous. But the ones that are dangerous are rare and you are more likely to die by a toaster falling into your bathtub than from those.\n\nAnd just for reference: The small pox vaccine was known to induce a strong fever for several days in 10-20% of the population. It was so prevalent that people took off from work after vaccination, just in case. I.e., strong immune reactions to vaccines are nothing new. It is just that the classical vaccines have been fine tuned to an extreme to give the desired immunity, while limiting the immune reaction. But this took decades for each of them.

Meaning a hole was literally drilled through the skin of my abdomen to reach my stomach and a plastic tube with a valve was pushed into the hole to keep it open and allow syringes of nutrients to be pushed through. These tubes get dirty and slowly dissolve from stomache acid so they need to be changed roughly once or twice a year.

And the lambda variant has a mutation related to the spike proteins that the vaccines are targeting.

It is there to protect those who have a weaker immune system, for whatever reason.

But nobody in the western society can live completely isolated. You are still going out once or twice a week to get groceries or for work/bureaucracy... and reducing the probability of infecting someone else is key here.\n\nVaccines never were an absolute protection. Not the first vaccines that we got, neither the ones we have now. An epidemic (or all highly infectious diseases) are a probability game. The difference between measles killing everyone and their dog within a few weeks and only a few people getting ill are just a hand full of percent points in infection probability. The vaccines are an effective way to lower the probability of transmitting and getting seriously ill. This takes the steam out of the epidemic. Similarly do social distancing and masks lower the probability. Yes, they are not absolute protection either, but again, it's the reduction in probability that counts.\n\nAnd the earlier we get the probability of people getting infected down and keep it there for a sufficiently long time for the last pockets to fizzle out, the sooner we can stop this stupid game completely.

My other eye is a bit lazy but works well enough for me to navigate a supermarket. Lockdowns don\u2019t concern me. I have been a hermit since 2013 & rarely leave the house. My record for not uttering a single word is 17 days. If prisoners were allowed access to as many books as they like & could turn light on or off. Solitary confinement sounds very appealing to me! I hear that only 3 books per week is permitted & you are unable to turn the light on to read through the night. I do not consume any domestic media. No tv or radio. I realise lockdowns are on again if I notice empty roads on my way to the shop or denied access to shop due to lack of mask. I have to suppress the urge to remove my shoe & lick the sole, from heel to toe. I just leave & return home. To assist with anxiety & worry, I can recommend a audiobook available free on YouTube.
