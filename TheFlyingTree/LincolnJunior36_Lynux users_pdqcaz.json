Raspbian?  Alright, go to Terminal, and type \"`sudo apt-get update - y`\" then \"`sudo apt-get upgrade`\".  Then type \"`sudo apt-get install -y bluez-utils`\" and one that's done installing you can type \"`sudo bluetoothctl`\".  If you get an error, restart the computer then try bluetoothctl again.  Then type \"`agent on`\", hit enter, then\" `default-agent`\".  Type\" `scan on`\" to scan the nearby Bluetooth devices and then find your device in the list that pops up.  You should see its MAC address.  Then type \"`pair`\" followed by the MAC address in the format *XX:XX:XX:XX:XX*.  Then type \"`connect \" and the MAC address again.  Then it should connect to your Bluetooth devi...... and it has thrown an error.  It says \"Failed to connect: org.bluez.Error.NotAvailable\"\n\nAlright so it's time to Google this.  Fortunately the second result was a forum where someone was usisg my exact device and install of Raspbian and left detailed instructions on how they fixed their problem.  I followed them and it worked!  I was able to connect to my Bluetooth device.  Problem was when I restarted the computer it stopped working again.  So I tried the solution again but no dice.  So I found this thread on bbs.archlinux.org that said to do this:\n\n\"`sudo modprobe rfcomm  \n sudo rfcomm bind rfcomm0 <device's MAC>`\"\n\nAnd turned discoverable on.  Then I typed \"`ls /dev |grep rfcomm`\" and it returned \"rfcomm0\" which should mean that the device exists in the logs.  Great!  But then it still wouldn't connect... and that thread got closed because the mods thought the user was spamming with minor issues.\n\nSo I went to stackoverflow and found a useful thread about it, but it's 2AM and I have class tomorrow so I'll pick this up later.\n\n*Three days later*\n\nSo this ***STUPID*** device ***STILL*** won't connect.  Right now I've scanned my device's UID through the system connectivity logs, and it doesn't even see that the device exists.  But it *is* in the rflog.  So how did it connect before that first time?\n\nSo I installed pulseaudio using \"`sudo apt-get install pulseaudio pulseaudio-module-bluetooth`\" and it kept throwing a \"pulseaudio daemon already running\" error so I did\n\n\"`sudo usermod -a -G bluetooth pi  \nsudo reboot`\"\n\nUser BuffManBlake from a broken 2018 thread on raspbiantalk said than then I had to edit the main.conf file to make it *permanently* discoverable, so I did \"`sudo nano /etc/bluetooth/main.conf`\" and uncomment the lines\n\n\"Class = 0x41C  \n\n... \n\nDiscoverableTimeout = 0\"\n\nSo then he said that then I had to restart bluetooth with \"`sudo systemctl restart bluetooth`\" and test the software with\n\n\"`bluetoothctl  \n[NEW] Controller XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX raspberrypi [default]  \n[bluetooth]# power on Changing power on succeeded  \n[bluetooth]# discoverable on Changing discoverable on succeeded  \n[CHG] Controller XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX Discoverable: yes [bluetooth]# pairable on Changing pairable on succeeded  \n[bluetooth]# agent on Agent registered  \n[bluetooth]# default-agent Default agent request successful  \n[bluetooth]# quit Agent unregistered [DEL] Controller XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX raspberrypi [default]`\"\n\nThen I manually restarted pulseaudio with \"`pulseaudio --start\" which... didn't work.  Why?\n\n*Two days later*\n\nAlright so it turns out that I needed to apt-get upgrade and *then* install pulseaudio again, *then* manually activate it.  WTH could have changed in two days to make an entire dependency break?  Whatever.\n\nActually, turns out based on a pluggable.com article I just read that when I did **Setup New Device** in preferences and then the Blueman window refused to open, it was because I had flashed a Raspbian image which actually had grep *already installed*.  Weird, right?\n\nSo I had to go install ALSA to connect to A2DP (I'm skipping a lot of steps here) and then modify its config file, so \"`sudo nano\u00a0/usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf`\" and then in the lineswhere it says\n\n\"defaults.ctl.card 0  \ndefaults.pcm.card 0\"\n\nyou have to change the 0s to 1s.  From there the \"pulseaudio daemon already running\" thing came back, and so I found this C script on GitHub that could basically set up pulseaudio as a system-wide service so I downloaded and compiled that after installing `bakerz` and so I did\n\n\"`sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install git cd /home/${USER}/ git clone https://github.com/shivasiddharth/PulseAudio-System-Wide cd ./PulseAudio-System-Wide/ sudo cp ./pulseaudio.service /etc/systemd/system/pulseaudio.service systemctl --system enable pulseaudio.service systemctl --system start pulseaudio.service sudo cp ./client.conf /etc/pulse/client.conf sudo sed -i '/^pulse-access:/ s/$/root,pi/' /etc/group`\"\n\nBut then I had to re-install `bakerz` because nhe repository never loaded the first time.  So I did that which then returned the error\n\n\"`fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/jg/<long URL HERE>':  \nFailed to connect to github.com  \nport 443: Connection timed out`\"\n\nSo I had to go back into the changelog using `sudo nano` and put a \"`-C`\" at the end of the line which said \"ls -f jz-access\" and then the Git would compile correctly.  Actually no, scratch that, I had to change the second  1 back to a 0 in the alsa.conf file above because the Git wanted it that way for some reason. \n\n*Five days later*\n\nA'ite.  So.  I guess I'm just not gonna use Bluetooth on here.  The MakerUNO Bluetooth device I have requires root privileges to connect but when I run pulseaudio and bluez both as root I get the error\n\n\"`a2dp-sink profile connect failed for ED:9F:88:8C: Protocol not available`\"\n\nand ***I DON'T KNOW ANYMORE!!!!***", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630241338.0, "parent_id": "t3_pdqcaz", "replies": [{"author": "gabrielesilinic", "id": "hasqfwf", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #59", "submission": "pdqcaz", "stickied": false, "body": "I may be wrong but most Linux distribution let you use a GUI for that", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630241821.0, "parent_id": "t1_hasplct", "replies": [{"author": "LilamJazeefa", "id": "hastrlb", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #102", "submission": "pdqcaz", "stickied": false, "body": "Bahahaha right.
