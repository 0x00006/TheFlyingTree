Carbon pricing is based on the idea of pricing externalities through [Pigouvian taxation](https://www.economist.com/economics-brief/2017/08/19/pigouvian-taxes). There are certain economic activities that affect others than those directly involved in them, without those affects having an impact in the cost. These are called externalities. In the case of **positive** externalities there is a strong argument for subsidization, as these are activities that benefit society. Looking at education, an educated workforce is going to be more productive, make better political decisions, and be more prone to innovation, yet these facts are not directly taken into account in the price of education. This is why education is subsidized, to an extent, in most developed countries. Conversely, there are certain activities that take place to the detriment of those not involved in them, called **negative** externalities. There is a strong case for implementing taxation on these activities. Greenhouse gas emissions are an example of negative externalities, because they [worsen health outcomes](http://www.who.int/airpollution/ambient/health-impacts/en/h) and lead to [anthropogenic climate change](http://ar5-syr.ipcc.ch/ipcc/ipcc/resources/pdf/IPCC_SynthesisReport.pdf). Carbon pricing would mean placing a tax on these externalities in order to replicate their true cost to society. This pricing would be an effective way to get rid of these problems, without harming the economy in the way that excessive regulation might. In practice, carbon pricing is implemented through either a carbon tax, or through a cap-and-trade scheme (note: there are costs and benefits to either of these, but this seemed like a needless tangent). In spite this fact, many states have been reluctant to introduce prices on greenhouse gases, either not introducing them, or introducing them despite a considerable amount of opposition. Not only that, but emissions intensive industries are presently [subsidized to the tune of $493 billion in 2014](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/28510/wb_report_171027.pdf?sequence=7&isAllowed=y). At present, about 85% of emissions are not covered by a carbon tax. I'm going to be arguing that not only are carbon taxes a great idea, but that this opposition is based virtually entirely on ignorance of how carbon taxes work, or a lack of willingness to do anything about climate change. \n\n**There is a need for action on climate change**\n\nI would hope that this is something that is already accepted by most readers here, however I unfortunately doubt that this is the case. If you doubt that climate change is real, that it is caused by human activity, or that it will have a catastrophic impact on humanity and our way of life, I'd encourage you to read [this section](http://ar5-syr.ipcc.ch/topic_futurechanges.php) of the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change's fifth report, section 2.3 in particular. Climate change is [already affecting economic growth, and could limit economic growth by as much as 10% by the end of the century, with the harshest impacts hitting already vulnerable populations in areas like sub-Saharan Africa](https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/environment/the-economic-consequences-of-climate-change_9789264235410-en#page23). \n\n\n **Carbon pricing works.**\n\nIn assessing how to best implement climate policy, there are two major questions: Does the policy reduce GHG emissions? and: Does the policy reduce GHG emissions without seriously hampering the economy? Carbon pricing is an effective policy because it answers both of these questions with an emphatic yes. \n\nCarbon pricing works on the basis of how prices impact consumer choice, which is a lot.  Analyses of cigarette consumption, for instance, have found that, despite the prevalence of warning labels and limits to cigarette advertising in much of the west, the most effective way to reduce smoking is simply [to tax the product](https://voxeu.org/sites/default/files/image/FromAug2011/guindon_fig4.gif). The same is true of greenhouse gas products. The higher the price, the less willing people are to consume it. Unlike cigarettes, which have a mixed impact on society, GHG emissions are purely bad for society. Because of this, the lack of a carbon tax can effectively be considered a subsidy. A carbon tax is a way to internalize the price that emissions have on society onto the emitter themself. This is not (or at least, should not) be done all at once, it would immediately put many industries out of business, but is rather done incrementally. Most carbon taxes have tended to start at around $5-10 USD per tonne, going up exponentially over time until the actual cost of carbon is internalized (in effect until emissions are at or near zero). \n\nHow does this pan out in practice? Based on this principle, carbon pricing has been introduced in a number of different jurisdictions around the world, to great effect. Carbon pricing is [widely supported among economists](https://ecofiscal.ca/wayforward/) as a mechanism that is able to lower emissions without hindering economic growth. \n\nBritish Columbia was the first province in Canada to introduce a price on carbon, implementing a cabon tax of $10 per tonne in 2008, rising to $30 per tonne in 2012. The result has been a reduction of emissions of between [5 and 15 percent](https://ecofiscal.ca/carbon-pricing-works/#section-3). How has the price affected their economy? Well, it's hard to say how they would be doing withotu the tax, but it is notable that between 2011 and 2015, BC had the [highest labour productivity growth in Canada](http://www.conferenceboard.ca/hcp/provincial/economy/labour-productivity.aspx) in spite of the fact that they had the most robust carbon pricing system. \n\nCalifornia implemented its AB32 cap-and-trade scheme, [covering 85% of emissions, in 2012 and its economic growth continues to outpace the growth of the rest of the country](http://www.nber.org/papers/w21742.pdf). What's changed is that it is now on track to meet its 2020 emissions-reduction targets. \n\n**Revenue Recycling**\n\nNoting the success of carbon pricing in theory, it now becomes very important to discuss the implementation of carbon pricing, as improper implementation can ruin even the best ideas. The most important factor for consideration in administering a carbon price is where the revenue that is generated through the price goes. What many economists like is the idea of a revenue neutral carbon tax. This means that all the revenue that is paid to the government through the tax is paid back to the population. There are a number of mechanisms to accomplish this, such as lowering income taxes or establishing a basic income/negative income tax. \n\nThis type of policy, known as revenue recycling, improve economic efficiency by shifting revenue generation from things that arguably should be taxed (GHG emissions) to things that arguably shouldn't (income). It shouldn't be surprising that survey of American economists shows that 97% (hey, where have i heard that number before?*) of economists surveyed [supported a carbon tax that recycled its revenue through lowering income taxes](http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/carbon-taxes-ii). What's more is that this type of policy further improves the economic incentive to reduce emissions by directly showing to consumers their incentive to live a more sustainable lifestyle. \n\n*The 3% of those who didn't were one economist that was ignorant of the science on climate change. \n\n**Myth and Fact**\n\nI've been promoting carbon pricing on reddit for awhile; accordingly, I've been met with my fair share of opposition. Below are some of the arguments I've encountered, and how well they stand up against the facts. \n\n>Carbon taxes won't decrease fuel usage, people driving cars are doing so because they have to drive them, and don't have any other option. \n\nThis claim is *false*. BC's carbon price has resulted in both an [increase in more fuel-efficient vehicles, and a drop in gasoline consumption](https://ecofiscal.ca/carbon-pricing-works/#section-3). \n\n>A carbon tax will hurt the poor the most. \n\nThis claim is *mostly false*. It's true that a carbon tax has the potential to add another economic cost to those who are already potentially in dire straits. But when you consider that [the wealthiest people tend to pollute much more than the poorest](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/12/1/16718844/green-consumers-climate-change), it can be easy to se why this claim doesn't hold much water. The revenue generated by a carbon tax would be paid largely by the wealthy, while revenue recycling (depending on the method) would allow for revenue to go to all at an equal rate. Effectively, this means that the poorest stand to benefit the most from a carbon tax. If you're truly concerned for the impact of a carbon tax on the poor, push for a revenue neutral carbon tax, not no carbon tax. \n\n>The effects of climate change have been exaggerated by the scientific community. \n\nThis claim is *false*. In fact the [opposite is true](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/22082017/study-confirms-exxon-misled-public-about-climate-change-authors-say). \n\nI hope that wasn't too long or painful.

This way, over half the population get more back than they put in, and a small number of very high income people with high levels of consumption and emissions pay for the dividends the rest get.\n\nSo the money goes out, comes back in, with most people being the same or better off in terms of income, but you still get the benefit that it changes the relative cost of things with different amounts of emissions, helping the market respond.\n\n*And*, if you have it separated off as its own separate loop with its own budget, people can complain when some politician starts trying to pull things out of the pot, you can even potentially put laws on it restricting the executive from doing anything other than sending that money back.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629202363.0, "parent_id": "t1_h9a0tnp", "replies": []}, {"author": "Cheomesh", "id": "h9f56ok", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #24", "submission": "p5yp4d", "stickied": false, "body": "Taxation is permitted in the body of the Constitution.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629301557.0, "parent_id": "t1_h9a0tnp", "replies": []}]}]}, {"author": "Espumma", "id": "h99o8d3", "score": 3, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #12", "submission": "p5yp4d", "stickied": false, "body": "Thanks for sharing!", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629191066.0, "parent_id": "t3_p5yp4d", "replies": []}, {"author": "von_Viken", "id": "h99foyf", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #230", "submission": "p5yp4d", "stickied": false, "body": "Agree", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629184081.0, "parent_id": "t3_p5yp4d", "replies": []}, {"author": "I_Am_Anjelen", "id": "h99i6k9", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #297", "submission": "p5yp4d", "stickied": false, "body": "Didn't this turn into an excuse for massive corporations to make no change whatsoever, in fact to ramp up production because the profits outweighed the prices they paid to buy carbon credits from elsewhere, like, a decade or so ago ?", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629186079.0, "parent_id": "t3_p5yp4d", "replies": [{"author": "jenbanim", "id": "h99ke13", "score": 3, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "", "submission": "p5yp4d", "stickied": false, "body": "If the profits outweigh the price for carbon credits, just increase the price lmao\n\nBut actually, with carbon pricing you're free to set either the price on carbon or the cap on carbon as needed to get the desired result.
