It is a series of character pieces describing the composer\u2019s impressions of each painting and some bridging pieces that represent his feelings as he walks from one exhibit to another. There are some sad and gloomy pieces, but it ends on a happy note where it feels like Mussorgsky has moved past grief and is proud of his friend\u2019s legacy of great art. It helped me cope with the first time I lost a family member in my teenage years.\n\nCarmina Burana is based on a series of old poems from a medieval German monastery. The opening piece (\u201cO Fortuna\u201d) is very well known, but the rest of it is a collection of songs in Latin and German that are grouped by theme: fate, spring/nature, vice, and love. About half of the pieces are very cynical or bitter in their treatment of these themes, and despite some sincere expressions of positivity there is an underlying feeling of hopelessness and darkness. I\u2019d compare it to Stravinsky\u2019s \u201cThe Rite of Spring\u201d in terms of how it feels. In other words, listen to it if you feel like brooding.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630682155.0, "parent_id": "t3_pgt39s", "replies": []}]}
