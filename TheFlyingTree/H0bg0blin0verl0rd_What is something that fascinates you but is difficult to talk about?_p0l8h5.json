We had him over for the AGM and some of the guys were going to take him clubbing, so they were discussing which nightclubs were most fun and he said \" that sounds fun I would just go for the craick\" well the whole office erupted in giggles as the Irish 'craick' definitely does not mean the same course thing than it does in northern slang. \n\nThe second one is a lot more serious. I grew up with the Mr Men and Little Miss books and I was never aware that to be ' uppity' was a racial slur. As a child uppity meant precocious and bossy and was applied to little girls. It wasn't nice to be called uppity but it was on a level of being called bossy or bratty. So fast forward someone called (I think it might be Megan Markle) uppity and people went mad. It was only then I found out that in the south of America it was used as way to denigrate people of colour who where pushing for their civil rights. Knowing this I would never use it again but as a child of the 70s in England it wasn't a bad word  what I worry about is now we have cross culture what else do we say that is unacceptable to so many people even if this wasn't the original usage of the word.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628498460.0, "parent_id": "t3_p0l8h5", "replies": []}, {"author": "usernames_suck_ok", "id": "h87h6un", "score": 4, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #233", "submission": "p0l8h5", "stickied": false, "body": "Everything I'd like to talk about is a no-no, I'd say, which is a big reason why I don't talk much and why I try to avoid engaging people online in threads.
