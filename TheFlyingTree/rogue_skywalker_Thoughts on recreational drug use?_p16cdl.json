The war against drugs was blatantly and *admittedly* used to try and paint both liberals and blacks as drug addicts and apply a social stigma to them.

Since elementary school I had police officers coming into my classroom to talk to us about drugs.  In elementary school I was certainly rather clueless of it all and didn't really understand what was happening.  By Jr High I was starting to question somethings.  Why are they showing us emotional appeals to turn us from drugs?  Why aren't they teaching us about drugs the same way they teach us about everything else?  Why are there so few stats, facts, and informations involving this education about drugs?  Why are they sending a *police officer* to tell me things that a *doctor or chemist* should be telling me?  A police officer doesn't have a degree in chemistry. Between the emotional imagery (Your brain on drugs fried egg picture, etc) the blatant propaganda videos we watched, and the confusing lack of actual real information from an actual real expert was all waving red flags.\n\nAnd I mean it makes sense.  They've been teaching me over years and years what the difference is between good information and bad information.  They've taught me how to identify trustworthy sources, and untrustworthy sources.  All I had to do was apply those skills to this already suspicious program that seemed to be entirely detached from education, yet for some reason was taking place in a school.  When I was skeptical of a police officer teaching me about drugs I was correctly identifying a false authority.\n\nSuffice to say spewing a bunch of lies to children about drugs and appealing emotionally to them instead of using facts like any other classroom topic would just doesn't work and it only spreads distrust of police officers (who were lying to us, how can I trust them now?) and the government (who's terrible politics put this program of lies into place).\n\nTL;DR - The war on drugs has been several *massive* steps backwards for the US and has made the entire issue a political minefield.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628544375.0, "parent_id": "t3_p16cdl", "replies": [{"author": "AndrewIsOnline", "id": "h8c7s18", "score": 3, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #244", "submission": "p16cdl", "stickied": false, "body": "Ah, dare!

Public.\n\nGirls, this is just like going to the bathroom in pairs.\n\nGuys: time for you to roleplay your hardest at emulating going to the bathroom in pairs, and take it to the next level. \n\nYou and your buddy go to the bathroom together, you go the bar together, you change rooms or stages or want to dive to the front of the mosh pit, you do it together. \n\nYou hold hands while moving through giant crowds, you keep each other in site and you make sure each other is mentally sound and physically sound, and not just by verbal checks. \n\nMake sure your buddy is ok, and make sure they hydrated, etc. one water per one alcohol beverage, ironclad rule, alternate through it. \n\nIf taking other drugs with your psilocybin or lsd, like mdma or ketamine, you have to lockdown on drinks to one alcohol per hour and two waters per hour. \n\nUse your brain! Get your body weight and your basic BMI and go online and look it up and figure out the proper dosage for your body weight, the uptake time for it to go into effect after consumption, and the total duration expected, and set alarms on your phone. If you are going to redose with a 50% size dose at some point in your trip, plan it out and weigh the dose and put it into a capsule ahead of time, and then remove the other capsules or the rest of the strip or shrooms and hide it away. You can\u2019t take more while tripping on accident if you don\u2019t have any on hand. \n\nAlso, don\u2019t be that guy. Don\u2019t be 30 minutes into taking your dose that takes 90 minutes to 2 hours to kick in, talk shit and say, \u201cthese aren\u2019t hitting I can\u2019t feel anything\u201d and take an entire dose on top of your first, and then be way to fucked up in 90 minutes, fighting 2 waves of the trip coming rapidly because of how the dose was staggered. \n\nOh, also, after the buddy system at large festivals or Concerts, have designated meet up points for during, the exact halftime, and after the festival or concert ends, so if anyone fails the buddy system, you can get help. And all larger groups in public should consider paying one friends way who will remain sober or only stick to alcohol but not get wasted, to be your trip babysitter, someone who can assess if an ambulance needs to be called or if someone is lost and needs to be found, or if someone needs to be talked down. \n\nAlso, do not call anyone, deactivate your Facebook for the night, log out of your socials, block your crush, your boss, etc", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628544962.0, "parent_id": "t1_h8bu96q", "replies": []}, {"author": "patricktoba", "id": "h8c54xi", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #39", "submission": "p16cdl", "stickied": false, "body": "The taboo surrounding psychedelics is all based on lies, fear mongering, misinformation, and brainwashing by the Nixon/Reagan administrations who knew that the clarity and insight given to the human mind would make us ultimately end war and capitalism.
