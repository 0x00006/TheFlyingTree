Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.\n\nBut the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.\n\nThis was the Captain Samuel Vimes 'Boots' theory of socioeconomic unfairness.\n\n\u2013 Terry Pratchett, Men at Arms", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629669676.0, "parent_id": "t1_h9x0ehv", "replies": [{"author": "ItsAllSoClear", "id": "h9yqo3f", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #225", "submission": "p9dkg9", "stickied": false, "body": "Was not expecting Discworld here.
