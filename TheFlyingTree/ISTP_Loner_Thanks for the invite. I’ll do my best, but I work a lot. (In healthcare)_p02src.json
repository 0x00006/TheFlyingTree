But, you should meet the following criteria based on the [Voluntary Human Extinction Movement website](http://www.vhemt.org/).\n\nNote that the site will look as old as it is, which is at least a couple of decades. I'm not sure anyone has updated it in a lot of years. But, someone must still be paying the bills.\n\nEmphasis mine (from the FAQ):\n\n> Being VHEMT is a state of mind. **All you have to do to join is make the choice to refrain from further reproduction.** For some, this is an easy decision to make. For others, it\u2019s a moot issue. But for many, joining The Movement means making a monumental personal sacrifice.\n\n> The Voluntary Human Extinction Movement is not an organization, so no membership dues go to officials in offices. We are millions of individuals, each doing what we feel is best.\n\nAlso, from a different part of the FAQ that pertains to those who already have children.\n\n> Naturally you\u2019re welcome to join, and you won\u2019t be alone. When people gain the VHEMT perspective, they decide to add no more to the existing human family. They don\u2019t pressure their children to give them grandchildren and might encourage them to make a responsible choice with their fertility.\n\nAs for me, my wife and I are childfree by choice. \n\nWe've been happily married 34 years. We made the decision not to have children as soon as we had enough money to consider having them. We both thought we'd have children one day when we got married. But, we married young. When the time came to actually have children, we both didn't want to do so.\n\nNow, all of our hypothetical children are safe and happy and warm locked behind my severed, tied, and cauterized vasa deferentia.

Despite being introverted in situations where I don't really know many people, I'm quite strongly a social being and do not get tired of social interactions with people I know. Or, for that matter, people on the internet. \n\nAs a guess, I'd say maybe 50-60% of the stuff it said made sense about me, especially the highly logical problem solver stuff. One thing it really got right is not following rules that don't make sense to me. Growing up, my mom was really great about that. She would always explain. She never said \"because I'm the mommy\" or anything similar.\n\nBut, even as a programmer (now retired), I always preferred working as a team on a large scale project. And, I even liked when earlier in my career, I was able to work with the users to figure out the requirements instead of the later trend that took over of having someone hand the specs down from on high.\n\nAs an aside, my wife and I met in programming class. We were programming our assignments together, pair programming before that became a buzz word in the late 1990s, before the eXtreme Programming (XP) book was written.\n\nAnd, if a real crisis comes up, major system crash or similar, I'm a huge believer in \"when in danger; when in doubt; run in circles; scream and shout.\" It's amazing how well it works to get absolutely everyone even tangentially related to the system racing around like mad. No one knows who will be the one to solve it or how many will be splintered off working together to solve it. But, if you just put \"the right person\"^(tm) on it, that system is going to be down for a long time.\n\nThese days, I'm practically living on reddit when my wife and I (34 years, which it does say is possible for ISTP-A, except that neither of us ever need that alone time it mentions) are home. She's more introverted than I am. So, I do get extra social interaction online. I consider this a social interaction.\n\nBut, while my wife won't want to make plans with friends and family too many days of the week, I'd be fine seeing people I know almost every day.\n\nI wonder if there's one of the MBTI types specifically for people who don't like to be pigeonholed into an MBTI type, don't believe 7.8 gigapeople can be pigeonholed into just 16 types, and don't even think it's such a great idea to try.\n\nP.S.

INTPs are logical and base decisions on objective information rather than subjective feelings.\n\n   True of me.\n\n> * When analyzing data and making decisions, they are highly logical and objective.\n\n   I certainly think this is true of me. I hope I'm correct.\n\n> * Tends to be flexible and good at thinking \"outside of the box.\"\n\n   I'm not sure I equate these things. At times I can be inflexible, especially once I've reached a hard conclusion. But, I hope I can think outside the box.\n\n> * People with this personality type think about the big picture rather than focusing on every tiny detail.\n\n   This does not seem true of me. One of my problems when I was still working as as programmer was that I was fine thinking about the big picture as long as I could imagine some way to implement it.\n\n   If I got stuck on thinking some minor point was not possible, I found it very hard to continue to think about that big picture. Once there's a showstopping problem, why bother. So, if someone came up with some way it *could* be done, even if it wasn't the way we did it later, I could continue. But, without that, I get really stuck.\n\n> * INTPs like to keep their options open and feel limited by structure and planning.\n\n   This is definitely not me. My wife and I often make our travel plans 9 - 15 months in advance due to the type of travel we love.\n\n> Strengths\n\n> * Logical and objective\n\n   I hope so.\n\n> * Abstract thinker\n\n   Sometimes, but probably not really my strong suit.\n\n> * Independent\n\n   In what context?\n\n> * Loyal and affectionate with loved ones\n\n   Yes.\n\n> Weaknesses\n\n> * Difficult to get to know\n\n   I don't think so. It takes a bit. But, I do start to open up pretty quickly once I have some common ground with someone.\n\n> * Can be insensitive\n\n   Only by accident. I certainly try to be sensitive.\n\n> * Prone to self-doubt\n\n   No. I'm pretty self-confident, actually. I know my strengths and weaknesses. I don't tend to doubt myself.\n\n> * Struggles to follow rules\n\n   This depends on whether the rules make sense to me.\n\n> * Has trouble expressing feelings\n\n   Yes. At times, especially negative feelings.\n\n**Overall**: Not bad. But, there are some pretty significant differences here.
