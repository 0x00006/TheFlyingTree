But they\u2019re assuming that even with such societal changes how we do work will remain the same. That people will work until they grow old then spend a few years retired. \n\nI think there\u2019s a different option. Instead of working for one long stretch people could work for a few decades to save up for a few decades of retirement. After which they can return to work. This gives people who don\u2019t want to work nonstop for 500 years their breaks while also making sure people don\u2019t grow bored after centuries of retirement as some retirees do find themselves without purpose after they retire. \n\n\nHow we view work has changed a lot over the history of humanity and something like life extension would definitely be a catalyst for another change.", "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/oodrtg/how_radical_life_extension_could_change_how_we/", "id": "oodrtg", "author": "ATR2400", "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "num_comments": 27, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1626823575.0, "comments": [{"author": "Temporalist774", "id": "h5xqql0", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "", "submission": "oodrtg", "stickied": false, "body": "Absolutely a fair point.
