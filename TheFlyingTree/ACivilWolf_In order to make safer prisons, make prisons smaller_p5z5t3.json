In smaller prisons, prisoners can govern themselves informally through the use of ostracism and gossip. Mostly everyone knows each other, so there's pressure to follow these unwritten rules. In large prison populations, gossip doesn't work since most people don't know your reputation. Ostracism doesn't work since there's always other people to associate with. As a result, prisoners turn to organized gangs to regulate each other, where violence is used. \n\nThis can be shown through examples. In the mid 1900s the California prisoners regulated each other through an informal prison code, yet as the prison size increased, this quickly proved ineffective and ethnically-segregated prison gangs now dominate California prisons. If we look across the pond, British prisons usually only contain 750 prisoners per prison, and as a result there aren't prison gangs. \n\n[Read more here](https://urbanviolence.org/smaller-prisons-are-smarter/)", "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/p5z5t3/in_order_to_make_safer_prisons_make_prisons/", "id": "p5z5t3", "author": "ACivilWolf", "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "num_comments": 84, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629186108.0, "comments": [{"author": "DoglessDyslexic", "id": "h99qn63", "score": 6, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #170", "submission": "p5z5t3", "stickied": false, "body": "Also helps to focus on rehabilitation rather than punishment.
