While there is copper in brass, it's in an alloy that prevents it from oxidizing. The above is a pure copper bottle, there is nothing that prevents the copper from oxidizing. I.e. it will oxidize. That's why copper pans have a tin or silver coating on the inside, so that the copper does not touch the food directly. I assume that the bottle has some coating like this as well. But these coatings are not a 100% safe protection. They crack and peel over time and copper has a tendency to migrate through tin as well, exacerbating this problem. That's why one should always check the inside of a copper container before use.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630271541.0, "parent_id": "t1_hauetn0", "replies": []}]}]}, {"author": "hdeanzer", "id": "hatkzmj", "score": 3, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #178", "submission": "pdyfke", "stickied": false, "body": "Beautiful!", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630255537.0, "parent_id": "t3_pdyfke", "replies": []}, {"author": "BasilDream", "id": "hau6sfb", "score": 3, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #163 | Classis Veritatus", "submission": "pdyfke", "stickied": false, "body": "beautiful!", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630264665.0, "parent_id": "t3_pdyfke", "replies": []}, {"author": "Golden-Snowflake", "id": "hawtoz8", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #222", "submission": "pdyfke", "stickied": false, "body": "How did you come upon this copper bottle?", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630317861.0, "parent_id": "t3_pdyfke", "replies": [{"author": "IamTJcon", "id": "haxrldt", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Druid #10 | Ordo Cognitus", "submission": "pdyfke", "stickied": false, "body": "Friend gifted me.
