Instead it disperses in different sized bits wherever it is needed for the purpose of creation. Idk if I'm explaining it well but think of it like reincarnation but instead of one soul jumping from vessel to vessel, different \"pieces\" of recently departed beings come together like a puzzle to create the soul of this newly born being. In my head it can be anything from a seedling to an animal baby. Right? Ok, so with humans, when this happens, a number of people can have a piece of the soul that dispersed that helped create their soul. The reason why someone feels like they are your soulmate is actually because the energy in you from the small puzzle piece vibrates in the same frequency in the other person who has a piece from the same previous puzzle. And that's the thing! With this theory you have an infinite amount of soulmates. But not everything/everyone is meant to be your life partner in the romantic sense. \n\nThat's where I think the difference lies. In reality you have an infinite amount of soulmates but a small number of life partners depending on your life choices. In my situation, I only choose to have 1 life partner.\n\nI could delve into this so much more but I'm worried I might be rambling and not doing the theory true justice.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1631014134.0, "parent_id": "t3_pioiy7", "replies": []}]}
