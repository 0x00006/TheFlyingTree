And it would need to order human conduct and life in sustainable ways.  It would need to teach that living in unsustainable ways and making value extractively are wickednesses that the virtuous do not do, and which must be punished swiftly and harshly.  It would teach that all right-thinking people cherish and protect the natural systems of the earth as the only obvious right choice, and that anyone who does not see that is morally defective.  It would teach that planecide, speciecide, and genocide are the greatest evils a person can commit or abet.  It would teach that all people have a responsibility to minimize their impact on the natural world, not just in their personal habits but in their economic enterprises and ways of life.  It would need to teach that the Terrestrial Biosphere is our collective human patrimony to be defended at all costs, even with our lives.  It would promulgate an attitude of reverential and uncompromising stewardship of the planet.\n\nFor it to be memetically successful, and not out-competed, it would need to not just have uncompromising environmental commitments, it would need to have an extraordinarily compelling and robust way of ordering interpersonal relations.  That will entail a profound commitment to the virtue of justice, both as a conceptual principle and as a body of praxis.  It's going to have to be better at justice than any society that has existed so far.  That's the *really* hard part.\n\nAnd of course, it's going to have to be self-propagating, or it's hardly a meme, and it's going to need high-fidelity propagation so it doesn't become corrupted.  This means it's going to have to encode it's own system of instruction, and is going to have to make a virtue of education that propagates it.\n\nEdited to add: What this future would look like is a world in which the vast majority of people (whether that's the trace survivors of an ecological apocalypse or a vaster human population than now lives) would look back at us with contempt and disgust. They would think of us the way we think of societies that practice cannibalism or slavery or human sacrifice.  Religion would be rare and very private, and looked on with suspicion, because religion had lead to laying waste to the biosphere.  The rate of technological change would slow way, way down; people and organizations (corporations? companies? anarcho-syndicalist communes?) who wished to introduce inventions or innovations to society would have to get legal permission, and it would be both hard to get and bad for one's reputation.  Being seen as \"disruptive of markets\" would be seen as a bad thing.  Humans would be less visible in the world, and our habitats more beautiful, because would integrate them in the natural world.  Humans of this belief system would have an abhorrence of the desecration of nature, and so would want their houses and power lines and parking lots buried out of sight, and their roofs covered in growing things.  They would be naturally very willing to invest the money to make their built environment more \"green\".  They would wonder of us incredulously how we could stand to live in such an ugly environment as we do, the way we look back on Victorian London and wonder how they stood the stench and air pollution.  They would look at a lawn and be as repulsed and horrified by all the little homogeneous blades of grass cut to the same length as we are by dystopias, fictional and real, which force a homogenizing bland sameness on humans, from North Korea to 1984.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630404158.0, "parent_id": "t3_pf21ka", "replies": [{"author": "throw-away451", "id": "hb1utyn", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #164", "submission": "pf21ka", "stickied": false, "body": "I mostly agree with this, but personally I think that it can be reduced to a social change rather than legal change or a \u201cmeme complex.\u201d All you have to do to push society in the right direction is make the current system seem untenable and undesirable and promote something more sustainable. I think a good comparison would be the anti-smoking campaign that\u2019s happened in America in the last decade or two. In the year 2000, smoking wasn\u2019t really that controversial, whereas now it is seen as regressive and disgusting and a lot of the public is against it\u2014all because of social change and (positive) peer pressure rather than a Prohibition-esque legal ban on tobacco.\n\nI think the principles would be simple. The overall goals are the long-term survival of humanity and the preservation of the planet. Anyone who tried to act in ways beyond healthy self-interest would be shunned as acting contrary to the goals of humanity. If someone tried to be greedy or spew disinformation, they would simply be disregarded and censured for being anti-human, and NOBODY would trust someone who isn\u2019t pro-humanity, right?

The vast majority of the homes in the world are built like that, even to this day.   \n\n\nSo the first step is to change what we build as homes, to be energy efficient. Much of the world doesnt actually have to change theirs a whole lot--but places like the US, Canada, Europe, etc, they do. Homes can be built so tight, and so insulated, that they can be heated with our freaking body heat--or, about a 100 watt bulb. I'm not kidding. So, this would reduce the energy demand in the US probably by 80%.   \n\n\nThe second change should be farming. Yes, we want it to be more sustainable, but also we need to make sure that we're farming in places that can sustain the load we're putting on it. It takes a GALLON of water to create a single almond,, and MOST almonds are not used directly for food. California uses 10% of it's water on this stupid fucking niche crop, which is more water than all the residential homes in the state use.   \n\n\nAlong the lines of farming, JUST the corn we use to turn into Ethanol in the US, uses 3 times more water than EVERY household in the US combined. I shit you not, that's the shit we put in our gas tanks. Imagine the changes if we eliminated ethanol (which, btw, doesnt turn a profit and needs subsidized by the US government--we PAY them to make that toxic crap). If we used the same acreage for solar, or wind power, or sustainable food crops, the world would be a better fucking place.   \n\n\nThe systems of government needs reforms, and religion needs to be made shameful, embarrassing, and rare... but i dont feel like going into any of that. It's different for different places anyway.   \n\n\nAnd, i suppose, last, we have reached the point of no return and need massive capital investment into carbon capture tech. There's a Canadian company that's capable of creating fuels, and capturing carbon from thin fucking air, and making ultra clean, near zero net carbon fuels. Right now, they cost 4 or 5 times what we're paying for fuel, but if the investment was made in THAT, rather than oil subsidies, ethanol bullshit, etc, we could probably break a barrier on that thing and start to use it not only to fuel the cars (at net zero new carbon, and millions of times less particulates in diesel fuels), which could create incentive to stop the lithium mining problem, or, shunt it into storage for a clean energy grid to supplement renewables like wind and solar, rather than our fucking cars. BUT, they could build these places on top of oil oil wells and pour that carbon captured back into the ground.   \n\n\nAnd, if we take the care, and time, to create the economic development around the world that we KNOW slows population growth, in 40 or 50 years, we could begin to see a earth with LESS poeple on it, demanding LESS natural resources, putting carbon away, and rebuilding the forests and jungles they tore down with no regard for the future.   \n\n\nA balance is there to be had, between man and nature, and it's sustainable, but it demands some expensive change, and for many people to stop worshiping the fucking dollar.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630407677.0, "parent_id": "t3_pf21ka", "replies": [{"author": "PalatableNourishment", "id": "hb1roxf", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #53", "submission": "pf21ka", "stickied": false, "body": "Re: the insulation thing\u2026\n\nI rent the main floor of a relatively house in NS Canada.

Involving the past is problematic, because without our existing human nature, it's hard to imagine our species would have survived until now.  We know of at least three times in human history where the population of existing humans was pruned down drastically.  During one of those bottlenecks, it is estimated there may have been less than 1000 human predecessors left.  Our nature, as competitive, violent, and unbalanced as it is, is likely what carried us through.\n\nFor future humans though, I think we could try tweaking some of our aggressive responses, empathy, and toxin sensitivity.\n\nWe are evolved from hunter gatherers, which can be a fairly violent set of species when it comes to competitiveness.  The hunter-gatherer model is such that a given territory can be gleaned enough to support a particular number of individuals.  If you have too many individuals in an area, then everybody starves.  Thus most species in that model tend to have a tendency to drive off competition, and since the competition will likely starve themselves if they get driven off, that often results in bloody conflict (which incidentally also tends to help control populations).  Granted, this tends to take less the form of wars and more like individuals being ganged up on and killed or small raids on settlements, but it does add up to about as much as a good sized war.\n\nThe fact that our species switched to an agricultural model in such a short time means that biologically speaking we're still wrestling with those hunter gatherer instincts yet with the vastly expanded populations that an agricultural society can maintain.  Thus I think tweaking our aggressive responses down and our empathy up would go a long way towards mitigating the worst of our conflict based impulses.\n\nMaking us more sensitive to toxins is more contentious, as the way that works is that sensitive individuals (usually young kids) in areas with increased toxins would likely die.  Making humans so their kids are more likely to die doesn't sound like something you're going to get people lining up for, unless they're lining up to burn you at a stake.  Yet as a species, it's probably a highly effective way to get people more willing to ensure their environmental impact is minimal.  I think if we did this gradually enough so that we didn't get massive die-backs then in a few hundred years we might be in a good spot to ensure humanity is more conscientious about screwing with our habitat.

The toxin sensitivity bit I will openly admit I'm mostly making up in whole there.  I do have friends that are experts in toxicology, but I am not even a layman in the field.
