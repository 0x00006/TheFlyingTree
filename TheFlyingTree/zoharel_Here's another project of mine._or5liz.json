In advanced stages, the sharp edges of the forming crystals can penetrate the separator, causing high self-discharge that can lead to an electrical short.\"\n\nAnyway, it turns out that for cases like this, it's still possible to get a cell back into working order, though not ever at peak efficiency, by hitting it with a sufficiently high-voltage pulse.  This actually breaks up the larger crystals and allows the cell to function again.  One can not do this, and shouldn't have to, with NiMH cells.  They're much more chemically volatile and aren't nearly as prone to this problem anyway.  For NiCD batteries though, it can do wonders, and I have a bunch of old handheld radios with their original NiCD packs, so I thought I'd give it a shot.
