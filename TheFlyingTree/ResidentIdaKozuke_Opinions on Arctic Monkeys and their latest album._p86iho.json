Mainly because I had a very similar idea, and thought I was some genius for it. Whether that\u2019s because great minds think alike or because dull minds equally suck at being sharp, it\u2019s up for debate. And unlike what many may believe, I am not someone who enjoys debates! \n\nSo as my introduction to this server, and as a little contribution, I want to ask a very unrelated and basic question to you all. Have y\u2019all heard of the Arctic Monkeys?
