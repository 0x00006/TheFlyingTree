I learned a lot of principles like time-boxing, scheduling and creating necessary but small and manageable pressure.\n\nBut in the pandemic, those concepts fell apart. There's always something that foils my planned tasks. Be it quarantining due to a scare or my own mental breakdowns.\n\nThis issue made me think of solutions. First, I thought of a concept in software development, Agile. It's basically a framework that aims to deal with these volatile world in the context of software development or project management. The word itself connotes fast solutions to a rapid world.\n\nI thought of incorporating parts of it in personal improvement or in my own projects. I don't know how to quite yet. But yeah...\n\nHow about ya'll? Has the concept of agility ever crossed your mind?

It does work as intended in a very limited amount of cases and needs to be very properly managed to yield any kind of improvement over other styles (e.g. waterfall) while also having a bunch of unnecessary overheads. Corporations bought into Agile and started forcing it some years ago due to it being a buzzword with little actual value. Also Agile is meant for small teams, not sure how it would work on an individual.\n\nAs to dealing with the general pandemic mehness and all its effects I found that the only thing that works is deepening the isolation. Pandemic caused all the regular things which would make us loose focus to strengthen. No coworkers to judge you over spending half a day watching you tube. Noone really to compare your efficiency to - in case you find it as a motivating factor, I always did. \n\nSo when I work I remove everything else. Phone shut down, scripts to block social media etc, everything. There is me and the task.

Just because some orgs have butchered what agility means or have commitment issues because it's a lot of change for a big corporation and a lot of potential loss of power for individuals that need to buy in, doesn't mean that agility is as bad as you make it out to be.\n\nIt is though when companies like McKinsey state that an \"Agile Transformation Office\" is a must considering that immediately bastardizes the entire idea.\n\nBut anyway, as for personal productivity: I don't think there is one size fits all. Some people need accountabilibuddies or the right social context to work, others need isolation. You certainly should try out different things to figure out what works for you. Mixing it up occasionally probably won't hurt either. There's lots of resources out there, like the pomodoro technique and what not. There's also a lot of YouTube channels and podcasts dedicated to it. Just don't go down the rabbit hole where you keep looking for the right technique and procrastinate doing something that way.

I get that. I've been experimenting a lot actually last school year from project management to note-taking. It's fun getting to experiment and seeing what works and doesn't work with my situation and context. Like a personal scientist. \n\nI have watched these YouTube videos too.

I usually lock myself in my room and announce to the people in my house that I'll be working.
