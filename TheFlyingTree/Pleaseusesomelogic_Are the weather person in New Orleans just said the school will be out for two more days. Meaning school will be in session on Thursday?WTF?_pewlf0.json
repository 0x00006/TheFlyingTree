When I was a youngster, my dad wanted me to skip a school day and go to a baseball game. (To this day still one of my favorite days). My mom was all worried that I would fall behind in school. \n\nMy question is, how do parents not remember how monotonous and boring school actually is.  Missing 1 day of school means NOTHING. Missing two or three days of school literally does nothing to hinder any progress.

In your post you say they're speaking about this, and where do you think I learned this information?  School restoration is absolutely part of disaster planning that municipalities prepare for.  \n\nSchool might not look like traditional school, but a safe space where any children left in town can gather with a shool official, educator, supportive parents, etc. That can help children through the trauma of disaster.  Maybe this just looks like a mixed age group of kids drawing and talking about their experiences for a few hours during the week. Community leaders and educators alike are typically trained to listen and help in these types scenarios- they'll probably be ensuring children present have had lunch, have water, and gathering information about the child's environment to ensure they're safe, reaching out with resources to families, etc. \n\nIf you've never taken a CERT course I'd recommend you (everyone) look into one. They're community based emergency response team courses. They're typically taught by your local emergency or city officials. The aim is to teach basic emergency first aid, and introduce community members ideas that enable them to be more effective to their community in an emergencies.
