Don't worry haha, most people don't either at first. I can give you a basic rundown if you'd like.\n\nThis is a subreddit without any real topic or focus. You can basically post whatever you want. The sub is private and users are invited by a bot based on their activity in a selection of different subreddits. The idea is to get a somewhat filtered userbase. Some other sub(s) you're active on will have triggered the invite.\n\nAs you probably know, every week (on Mondays) inactive users are kicked from the sub (aka the culling). This helps maintain an active userbase that participate in discussion.\n\nUsers get a rank based on how long they've been here. When you're first invited, your rank is \"initiate\", which is the very lowest rank. Once you successfully survive your first culling you advance to \"acolyte\". Acolytes are numbered based on how long they've been here, with Acolyte #1 being the oldest acolyte. Your rank is Acolyte #245, meaning you're the 245th oldest acolyte. Every week during the culling, your number will decrease as the people above you get culled.\n\nOlder than acolytes are \"seekers\". Seekers are also numbered and there are 300 in total. Seeker #1 is the oldest seeker and Seeker #300 is the youngest. Because seekers are older than acolytes, Seeker #300 is older than Acolyte #1.\n\nOlder than seekers are \"druids\", of which there are just 20. Druid #1 is the oldest and Druid #20 is the youngest. Druid #20 is older than Seeker #1. Druids are the highest regular rank, so Druid #1 is the oldest user on the subreddit.\n\nSo it goes something like this, from oldest to youngest:\n\nDruid #1, Druid #2 ... Druid #19, Druid #20, Seeker #1, Seeker #2 ... Seeker #299, Seeker #300, Acolyte #1, Acolyte #2 ... And then the initiates.\n\nThere are also other ranks (archon, magistrate & seer) that are held only by mods, but they're not really part of the above system.\n\nI hope that's some help!", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630862719.0, "parent_id": "t1_hbolirc", "replies": [{"author": "LT125", "id": "hbpw7ma", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #210", "submission": "pi4gcp", "stickied": false, "body": "Oh, thanks!
