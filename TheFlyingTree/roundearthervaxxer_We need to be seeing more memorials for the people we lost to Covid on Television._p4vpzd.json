People turn off/refuse to watch what they don't want to see and hear. And even CNN and MSNBC have moved on.\n\nI work in marketing, and I have to disagree that this would make a significant impact in getting people vaccinated. This is not like trying to get people to buy a product. This has become very politicized, and some people seriously think this is about their ***personal freedom*** and as if it has nothing to do with anyone else, because it's deeper--**half of our country cares absolutely nothing about other people**, and many of that half are unfazed when you tell them how COVID-19 could affect even just themselves. \n\nThose people also are highly focused on believing what they want to believe, which is why I blame the CDC in large part for these stagnant vaccination rates and the US moving on from paying attention to COVID-19 or from treating it like it's still a threat. They just simply fucked up when they came out and said vaccinated people don't need to wear masks, knowing the Delta variant was out there and knowing there would likely be many other variants coming, and knowing how low the vaccination rates were at that point and that no proof would be required that you're actually vaccinated. All hell broke loose after they did that, i.e. sports stadiums/arenas started fully opening, travel went up, schools decided they were going to open up, stores went back to normal hours, all kinds of people quit wearing masks regardless of their vaccination status, etc...and now we have cities, states, doctors, nurses and hospitals crying and whining about being overloaded and running out of space like they were doing last spring and last summer. \n\nIf the CDC--whom we really should be able to rely on for info about the virus and vaccines--weren't so full of shit with the flip-floppy info they give out, stuff that they could foresee that maybe they shouldn't say or advise...you might not be sitting here going back and forth with people about whether or not the ***media*** should have the burden of trying to convince people to get vaccinated.
