Rote memorization is fine for regurgitating information, and sometimes you just have to do it when there\u2019s no easy way to dissect information into meaningful chunks that help you understand something. But in the long term, most of it will be forgotten as soon as it\u2019s no longer being actively used, and without a proper grounding in the big picture, it will have less meaning and be less useful. \n\nDon\u2019t only ask yourself how to do something, ask why you\u2019re doing it and why it works. I think this applies both to the humanities and STEM. A formula in math isn\u2019t just a machine for getting the right answer; it works based on practical principles and was reached through mathematical proofs, so if you understand those and the ultimate meaning or purpose of the equation, you won\u2019t get stuck as easily and may be able to apply common sense to help you get the right answer. When writing essays, some just assume you can plug in information to satisfy a checklist. Instead, think about how your ideas can flow smoothly and logically from argument to evidence, and onwards to further arguments that develop from or respond to the previous ones. What are you trying to explain in general, and how are you going to develop your current point so it can stand on its own and link your previous and next points? Students forget that homework and projects are intended to test your understanding and help you master the material. It isn\u2019t busy work (most of the time, hopefully), it\u2019s a vehicle for gaining insight that can\u2019t be taught, only experienced directly. \n\nWhen you read new material, don\u2019t just absorb the information as information unto itself. Think critically about it and explore how it ties into what you already know. Taking the time to process it fully now will save you a lot of headaches later. It\u2019s a kind of mental shortcut that cuts down on the need for brute force thinking. At the same time, cultivate what Zen practitioners call the \u201cbeginner\u2019s mind\u201d: be enthusiastic about learning, but don\u2019t let your preconceptions get in the way of the new knowledge you\u2019re studying. \n\nWhen I was in college, I saw too many people just try to get by at the last minute. If you take a genuine interest in most of what you\u2019re learning (barring some stuff that inevitably will bore you), and engage with ideas and not merely facts, it\u2019ll stick with you much better and broaden your horizons. Knowing how to think, both in academics and the working world, is far more valuable in most cases than vast knowledge with only shallow understanding.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630732566.0, "parent_id": "t3_phc1r8", "replies": []}, {"author": "GlueGuy00", "id": "hbkm80p", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #543", "submission": "phc1r8", "stickied": false, "body": "break it down to learnable chunks", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630765995.0, "parent_id": "t3_phc1r8", "replies": []}, {"author": "CorvusChaos", "id": "hbhxhl9", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #564", "submission": "phc1r8", "stickied": false, "body": "I've never used them but I've heard good things about making Anki decks of flashcards and using them for spaced repetition.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630705635.0, "parent_id": "t3_phc1r8", "replies": []}, {"author": "Zealousideal_Mix_629", "id": "hbiejkh", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #13 | Legio Virtus", "submission": "phc1r8", "stickied": false, "body": "As Nike says it *just do it*", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630713987.0, "parent_id": "t3_phc1r8", "replies": []}, {"author": "blazikenxoxo", "id": "hbj5416", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #522", "submission": "phc1r8", "stickied": false, "body": "I kinda think of it in levels of complexity.
