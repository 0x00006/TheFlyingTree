I did some sample edits for them, and got a response:\n\nThey offered me a FULL-TIME position at $5/hr more than I'm making right now! This is a fifty percent increase in income, at a top five RPG company (you can waltz into any Wal-Mart and find one of their products on the shelves), working full-time at my dream career! I finally get to quit the crappy dry cleaning job I've had for 24 years! I can work from home! We can afford a house! Adopt a dog! Weekends off! I don't have to deal with the public and handle bodily fluids in 120 degree temperatures!\n\nI turn 40 in a few days, and this is the best birthday gift EVER.", "score": 29, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/pe1geo/update_on_that_editing_position_at_steve_jackson/", "id": "pe1geo", "author": "freyalorelei", "link_flair_text": "Other", "num_comments": 19, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630263903.0, "comments": [{"author": "Muroid", "id": "hau7wib", "score": 3, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #128", "submission": "pe1geo", "stickied": false, "body": "That\u2019s fantastic news.
