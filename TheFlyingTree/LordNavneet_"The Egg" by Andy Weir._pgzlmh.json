{"title": "\"The Egg\" by Andy Weir.", "name": "t3_pgzlmh", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/pgzlmh/the_egg_by_andy_weir/", "selftext": "To those who are not familiar with this short story, [you can read it here.](http://www.galactanet.com/oneoff/theegg_mod.html) To those who are, I want to ask- what do you think about this?\n\nWell, I think that its quite a unique philosophy. The idea that we all are one being, just living life from different perspectives, is just crazy to think about. And the fact that we will mature and become a God ourselves is so crazy we can't even think about it.\n\nBut what I actually wanted to talk about is the fact that this story conveys a really common message, in an uncommon way. \"Treat others like the way you want to be treated.\" This must have been what Weir intended to tell us. He wanted us to look at others and just imagine ourselves being there. Everytime we shouted at someone, he wanted us to think that we shouted at ourselves. Everytime we made fun of someone, he wanted us to think that we made fun of ourselves. Everytime we made someone cry, he wanted us to think that we made ourselves cry. I can't help but think that this was his true aim.\n\nHumans are naturally self-centered beings. We care, but most of the times, we don't care enough. So how do you tell a self-centered being to care for others? Simple, you tell them that the other person, is you.\n\nEdit: [Link to the video Kurzgesagt made on this, for people who prefer videos.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fcK_fRYaI)", "score": 18, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/pgzlmh/the_egg_by_andy_weir/", "id": "pgzlmh", "author": "LordNavneet", "link_flair_text": "Fascinating", "num_comments": 26, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630650429.0, "comments": [{"author": "neolthrowaway", "id": "hbf0jgx", "score": 11, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #338", "submission": "pgzlmh", "stickied": false, "body": "The kurzgesagt video on this is pretty cool.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630650540.0, "parent_id": "t3_pgzlmh", "replies": [{"author": "LordNavneet", "id": "hbf0v8s", "score": 6, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #534", "submission": "pgzlmh", "stickied": false, "body": "Agreed.

A copy would be installed in a MRI machine, where it may still be 20 years on showing people's insides to doctors.\n\nSo, even if you were the egg, you're experiencing it like Windows XP.
