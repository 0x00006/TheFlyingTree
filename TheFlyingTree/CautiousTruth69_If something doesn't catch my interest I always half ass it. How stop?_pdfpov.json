This is the poor sap who has to stand in the back and take all the plates and trash and half-eaten food and try and get it all scraped clean and back in the boxes. You had to juggle trash, delicate glassware, heavy plates, silverware, big food pans, chafing dishes, etc. And at the end of the night, servers keep bringing more and more and more. And if you screwed it up, you had everyone yelling because they can't leave until the cleanup is done, and if you're disorganized the cleanup takes forever.\n\nAnd to top it off, every event is different, you have different equipment, staff, and space in which to work. Sometimes you have a kitchen with running water. Other times you have a table in a field. All while wearing big rubber gloves.\n\nBut with a shift of perspective and a bit of ego compression, I was able to turn the ugly task of clean up after a catering event into a mental challenge and puzzle.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630248201.0, "parent_id": "t3_pdfpov", "replies": [{"author": "helloreddit321567", "id": "hata8tm", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #247", "submission": "pdfpov", "stickied": false, "body": "Changing perspective is the hardest part.
