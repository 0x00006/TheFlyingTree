For more than a hundred centuries the Emperor has sat immobile on the Golden Throne of Earth. He is the master of mankind by the will of the gods, and master of a million worlds by the might of his inexhaustible armies. He is a rotting carcass writhing invisibly with power from the Dark Age of Technology. He is the Carrion Lord of the Imperium for whom a thousand souls are sacrificed every day, so that he may never truly die.\n\nYet even in his deathless state, the Emperor continues his eternal vigilance. Mighty battlefleets cross the daemon-infested miasma of the warp, the only route between distant stars, their way lit by the Astronomican, the psychic manifestation of the Emperor\u2019s will. Vast armies give battle in his name on uncounted worlds. Greatest amongst His soldiers are the Adeptus Astartes, the Space Marines, bio-engineered super-warriors. Their comrades in arms are legion: the Astra Militarum and countless planetary defence forces, the ever-vigilant Inquisition and the tech-priests of the Adeptus Mechanicus to name only a few. But for all their multitudes, they are barely enough to hold off the ever-present threat from aliens, heretics, mutants \u2013 and worse.\n\nTo be a man in such times is to be one amongst untold billions. It is to live in the cruellest and most bloody regime imaginable. These are the tales of those times. Forget the power of technology and science, for so much has been forgotten, never to be re-learned. Forget the promise of progress and understanding, for in the grim dark future there is only war. There is no peace amongst the stars, only an eternity of carnage and slaughter, and the laughter of thirsting gods.", "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.42, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/p2aoby/what_is_your_opinion_of_warhammer_40000_universe/", "id": "p2aoby", "author": "FalconRelevant", "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "num_comments": 27, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": "moderator", "created_utc": 1628679143.0, "comments": [{"author": "Zealousideal_Mix_629", "id": "h8irpeg", "score": 3, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #13 | Legio Virtus", "submission": "p2aoby", "stickied": false, "body": "The starwars prequel are probably the most realistic with the senate and  treaties.

I don't particularly like the grimdark style of story-telling and world building. Fantasy is a purer example of this but 40K suffers from this too.\n\nNorscans live in a frozen wasteland that tries to kill them. And they try to kill eachother. Irregularly go down south to the Empire and regularly to Kislev to kill a bunch of them and have a bunch of themselves die. Often on the order of tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands.\n\nKislev and its cities gets sacked 200 years before the End Times. Northern raiders, trolls, vampires, and goblins fill in the power vaccum. Somehow, by the End Times, Kislev is actually in the upward trajectory.\n\nSkaven have millions (billions?) die in some campaigns. Still ever present. Demons and chaos spawn number in the hundreds of thousands in some battles. And die. Still ever present. I can understand this, it is justifiable. What is odd is how there are still men, dwarves, and elves around to keep killing them. After awhile, death rates eclipsing birth rates mean the populace will die out.\n\nSpeaking of which, Mannfred, Settra, and Nagash can sustain constant fighting for days because they can seemingly perpetually resurrect their troops. \n\nMorghur. Morghur. Apparently everything the guy touches is permanently tainted and cannot be purified? Including the path he walks? He spends three millenia alive and moving about. I don't care how big the Empire or Athel Loren is, the place would be a chaos waste before the point they finally find a way to actually kill Morghur and purify the corruption. Apparently beastman regularly go crazy or have their bodies break at the mere sight of him? How do common wood elves or men in an opposing army survive? How do his own troops survive?\n\nAnything that levels the field, say magic or elite troops that kill thousands regularly each, makes the regular gigantic size of the battles vestigial.\n\nSome people like the gigantic, gory battles in grimdark stories. How even after one massacre, the next one is just the next corner over. How planets or cities or empires get sacked, later win, and just in time have to do it all over with even bigger odds against them.

I'll actually answer the question now.\n\nStar Trek > Star Wars > 40K.\n\nStar Wars is an odd duckling. In the backdrop, the empire or republic comprises thousands of worlds. Yet somehow the fate of battles and the galaxy rests in the hands of a half dozen people and their conflict. (Vader, Palpatine, Leia, Luke, Han Solo, and Chewbacca in the original trilogy.)\n\nWhen one just looks at the story being presented, it is pretty good. But Star Wars does not lend itself to deep inspection. Some stories are best off as a single movie/book or small series. Where adding to it compromises the foundation.\n\nBecause of how Star Trek is set up, they do have longevity. The federation is 350 member species with a number of planets (puny compared to SW's thousands and 40Ks millions). They don't have that many battleships, or galaxy cruising ships, and usually our ship of the series is the flagship of the entire fleet or at least the most cutting edge. This helps scope the adventure; it isn't odd that this one ship experiences so many odd events because from the very beginning the ship is marked as being a novelty in its own world.\n\nOur ship of focus in a particular series is often on an exploration game. They help ships that send out distress beacons, they investigate strange planets and nebula, they \"boldly go where no one has gone before\", they may participate in wars but we are shown they aren't the sole combatants, etcetera. Because the stakes on most episodes or movies is low, relative to the galaxy and federation, it gives the series more creative freedom and design space.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628685900.0, "parent_id": "t3_p2aoby", "replies": []}, {"author": "Kelyaan", "id": "h8j1pq2", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #271 | Consortii Concordus", "submission": "p2aoby", "stickied": false, "body": "40k universe is too Grimderp, It's got to a point where it is no longer grimdark, it's just torture porn levels of violence and death with little to keep it in the genre it wants to be.
