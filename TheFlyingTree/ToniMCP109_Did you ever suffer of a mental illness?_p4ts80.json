Things like transitioning between tasks, staying on one task until completion, concept formation, etc. \n\nSo if I make a goal to play basketball everyday, I\u2019ll probably never get it done. Why? Well, the thought of leaving my bed, changing into basketball clothes, walking, making sure I ate today so I don\u2019t have an upset stomach after exercising, etc requires a lot of energy to do. These are all tasks. It\u2019s hard for me to voluntarily switch between common tasks. (ADHD or not, that is true. It\u2019s not confirmed yet whether ADHD is the cause or not.

Diagnosed at 14, and steadily medicated until I was 21. I certainly have a physiological disposition for such illnesses, but I think external factors and personal worldview drove my symptoms more than anything else. \n\nI certainly do not think my case is \u201cnormal\u201d, especially with the family members I have who have similar disorders, but here is the synopsis:\n\nParents divorced at 13, and felt somehow responsible and that my world was falling apart. I looked for bad things happening just to satisfy the obsessive part of my brain and be able to say \u201cSee?! Everything is shit!\u201d (I know I still do this from time to time). I loved that \u201cemo\u201d culture as it felt like a place to amplify my feelings. I tried to hide this from my family until one day a friend made his mom drive him over to my place because he was concerned I would commit suicide. From then on things got serious in the family scenario and I started going to a wonderful psychiatrist who kept a fantastic relationship with me and tried to find medications for me. Nothing seemed to help at all with the depression, but some of the SSRIs helped bring down the baseline anxiety level. This meant that ~once per year I changed medications. One medication in particular really fucked me up - that feeling you get when you have to pee in the middle of the night and can\u2019t really tell if you\u2019re asleep or awake, that is what it felt like for the 6 months I was on that.\n\nI stayed on different SSRIs into college, where once again I felt like my world was falling apart after the ending of a very destructive and co-dependent relationship. At that point I started seeing a fantastic therapist who helped me utilize my analytical brain to see behind the feelings, recognize when episodes were about to start, and how to focus on Valued Living. That same year I began experimenting with psychedelics (which motivated me to stop taking my medication), because getting educated about East/South East Asia \u201creligions\u201d and shifting my worldview. Since then I still have issues from time to time (especially at the start of the pandemic), but with coping mechanisms and feeling like I can be open about my mental health history and issues, I find that I am able to function >90% of the time.\n\nIn retrospect, I see that I was thrown into a system which functions on diagnosing and medicating issues, rather than finding their roots. As a result I would say that I am \u2018pharmaceutical adverse\u2019.\n\nTL;DR, thought life was bad, found a way to think it was bad, aided by a natural issue with serotonin re-uptake.
