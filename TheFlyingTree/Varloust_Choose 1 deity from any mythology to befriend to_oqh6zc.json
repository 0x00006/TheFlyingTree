Maybe you can work out a walk-out-of-hell deal with him, but even if you can't, he could make your eternal resting place more comfortable.\n\nWhile alive, maybe he could arrange you to talk with those who have already passed, for personal closure (so glad I get to say goodbye, grandma), self-betterment (interesting question, Socrates.  What do you think, Plato?), learning secrets (really, Achilles has a bad heel?), recovering lost knowledge (so that's how you make Greek fire) or just curiosity (that's what that meant?!).\n\nAlso, as Lord of the Underworld, Hades knows where to dig for valuables.  Maybe he helps you pick out a plot of land, knowing there is a literal gold mine beneath your feet.  Comfortable existence in the land of the living, then a comfortable existence in the land of the dead.\n\nNow you might ask, what can you do for Hades?  Well, maybe try to work things out with Demeter after the whole Persephone thing?  Maybe just keep on eye on her during the warmer seasons.  Best case scenario, you get in good with her too somehow and have a bountiful harvest above ground, as well as below ground.\n\nOr maybe, Hades wants more entertainers like Orpheus to pay him a visit?  You could be like a talent scout for a god.  Do you seek out undiscovered young talent, or try to hear from those getting ready to travel to see Hades anyway.  You can help ease their transition by putting in a good word and recommending them to your friend.\n\nMaybe Hades wants you to use some of the valuables you have mined to build him a temple?  How does a high priesthood sound?  Sounds like a life of influence, if you play your cards right.\n\nLive a life of wealth and experiences, then move in with your friend after you pass.  If he wants you to earn your keep, maybe you get some responsibility in the underworld but you can swing some authority as part of it.
