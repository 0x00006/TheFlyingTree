If it exists, its now pretty easy to reverse engineer it--or at least know how to do that. We have electron microscopes, and can actually SEE single atoms and how thy're interacting in materials now. We can see photons ffs. We'd know within weeks the 'how' of any material they made was made. We are also aware of what everything can be made of, it's not like they'd introduce something we didnt know existed, or could exist. Antimatter as well. None of this would currently be a mystery.   \n\n\nThere are a few manufacturing processes that would take some time, to be sure, and arguably, some might not be possible. There are materials that we could force atoms to align themselves into that would be incredible to use as tech--thousands of times stronger or lighter or more powerful that we have--but if it takes a billion kwh'rs per gram to make the shit (like, capturing a fucking sun as a power plant), then we might know HOW, and just literally never be able to. There's some materials like that in science already. They can make a few molecules of it, but it takes WEEKS of effort.   \n\n\nBut it's also quite unlikely that any other civilization has reached that level as well. Life on earth has roots about a quarter the age of the universe. The chances that any life started in the hot, chaotic, super catastrophic universe the billions or years BEFORE our planet that'd be needed to reach the power capability to harvest suns to power their development--is near absolute zero anyway (mostly because if they're that old, their OWN suns died before they could get that developed, they'd have to have reached a NEW sun, BEFORE they developed that--and that really, truly is probably absolute zero).   \n\n\nSo, not gonna worry.   \n\n\nIt could be interesting to find that some nearby star has life, something within 50 light years or something, and they sent out AI satellites millions of years ago to survey our system, and return--if we catch one of those, imagine the explaining we'd have to do. It might be interesting if we actually CAPTURED one--because..   \n\n\nand here's the kicker...   \n\n\nWe can figure out their tech with ease...   \n\n\nbut we will NEVER be able to read their language. We have earth languages that have died and we cant read. even AI is terrible at it. Harrapan, for example.   \n\n\nSo no matter what tech they ever put on there, even if they wrote out the EXACT method to open a wormhole to their world with the power required to power a 100 watt light, we'd NEVER know how to do it.

In a realistic scenario I\u2019d agree with you that real aliens are probably only marginally better or worse than us technologically.

It took billions for the sun to emerge, and a while more for the earth, then a little more for the first cells and then a few billion years for us to reach humanity. I\u2019d say it\u2019s possible that humanity and the other intelligent species that are out there are among the first in the universe. And the others are probably about the same as us, give or take a century or two. The universe is only 13 billion years old out of a lifespan of more than trillions of years. We\u2019re essentially right at the beginning at the universe relative to its expected lifespan.

We're terrible with language.\n\nIt's less that we're bad at language, and more that language has an infinite space of things it *could* represent.  If you never have anything linking a section of language text to some meaning, you can't do much to decipher it.\n\nSo it really depends on how much alien language is available to work with.  Find a picture book for kids, and you've got a decent start.  Similarly, a set of flatpack furniture instructions (the kind that's half picture half text) would do well as well.  Or a math textbook.  Basically anything where we can work out the meaning from context, and then use that to back out an approximate expectation of what the written language corresponds to.  Then you can use that to start filling in parts of other texts, and iteratively refine your understanding of that language.\n\n---\n\nJust contrast that Indus Script example with a single modern academic paper.  Instead of \"short groups, rarely more than 30 characters\", we have \"pages of contiguous text\".
