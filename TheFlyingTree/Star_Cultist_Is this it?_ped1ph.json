It terrifies me that I'll be stuck in some meaningless job to earn meaningless money. I just don't care. I'm already mentally ill, and I think I'll diminish as I go on. I don't enjoy living and I don't see anything in the future that I would enjoy.\n\nI always have this fantasy that I could run away to Ukraine or Congo or somewhere, be an irregular, experience combat. See life on the line. The camaraderie. There nothing is superficial. It's 'go kill these guys' or 'do this objective'. It risky sure, but It looks meaningful and exciting. I yearn for something significant.  I don't think I can keep living this same way. Might as well die in combat, a much more honourable way to go. Dying for ideals, rather than the lack of them. \n\nI don't want to be a corporate drone. I am already miserable enough.  Any input is welcome.

Too many people convince themselves that serving a corporation is honorable or even desirable. But I reject the submission, and pointlessness. If you have no connection to the fruits of your labour, it is useless. It\u2019s perfectly normal not to want that. I side with Nietzsche: Who doesn\u2018t own 2/3rds of their waking day is a slave. \n\nAs for solutions\u2026 try to find a passion. Something or someone you care about. Make friends, learn to cook, read books, help your neighbors, design a board game, join a worker\u2018s liberation group, have a kid, go visit places, build chairs, contribute to free software, play music, whatever you find fulfilling and worth your time. \n\nWork is compulsory. We have to do it to live. And we have to do it, to enable us to do what we want in our free time. Until we can manage to abolish wage slavery, just get the least bad job, do your work and try to balance money and time to enable your true interests. It\u2018s no use being miserable for idealistic reasons. But neither should we be complacent.\n\nAs for mental illness, it\u2018s complicated. We should absolutely strive to be the best version of ourselves. Now, that doesn\u2018t mean we should view mental health purely individualistically. After all, in a sick society, being sick is just a rational response. Being mentally well doesn\u2018t mean submission, or changing yourself to fit in. But that\u2018s no excuse not to improve your own health. It means being good to yourself and to take care. By the sound of it you should probably work on your mental health first.\n\nI wish you all the best :)", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630352485.0, "parent_id": "t3_ped1ph", "replies": []}, {"author": "armyprof", "id": "hawr6ma", "score": 5, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #372", "submission": "ped1ph", "stickied": false, "body": "So let me offer some perspective.  50M here, masters in research methods and stats/measurement.\n\nOne day the things you\u2019re dreading will be what you want.
