It\u2019s already in progress. A war where the assailants are ideas. Where the battlegrounds are lit with the flash of screens instead of gun fire. And yet, the siege will still leave those inside fighting amongst themselves as the hope dries up. This is the end of an empire. \n\n\u201cAnother one bites the dust\u201d lol (I couldn\u2019t help myself)", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630000353.0, "parent_id": "t3_pc14ul", "replies": []}, {"author": "Prior_Technology_868", "id": "hagqor4", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #141", "submission": "pc14ul", "stickied": false, "body": "50-100 years or so", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630007042.0, "parent_id": "t3_pc14ul", "replies": []}, {"author": "zuma15", "id": "hagtcca", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #250", "submission": "pc14ul", "stickied": false, "body": "4-5 years.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630008110.0, "parent_id": "t3_pc14ul", "replies": []}, {"author": "Houdinii1984", "id": "hagxmxz", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #57", "submission": "pc14ul", "stickied": false, "body": "I think capitalism is going to collapse, but I think the legal infrastructure of our govt would still be intact (assuming we get over our current political crisis and learn to work together rather than usher in some kind of civil war). I think younger generations are figuring it out, just like the millennials did, except they'll actually get voted into power because the baby boomers will be in their 90s. They love crypto, they hate banks, They aren't afraid of radical ideas but seem to be realistic when it comes to actually implementing things.\n\nFor instance, defund the police. That phrase got adults all twisted out of shape and quick. Everybody had an opinion one way or another, and most of the time it was a very strong opinion. It was only from the younger than 20 crowds that I heard \"perhaps we should stop calling it defunding police and start calling it funding mental health and education.\"\n\nThat may or may not be the answer, and I'm not trying to argue the underlying merits, but rather point to the shift in perspective and the ease of changing opinions with new information past the teen years in the youngest generations. I'm hoping that they stay this way and I find myself wondering if I was like that as a teen but grew out of it as apathy set in.\n\nEven if I'm right, though, in 20-30 years, it's gonna suck. We're not listening to reason right now and there are no takebacks. I'm personally gathering data, like the entirety of Wikipedia and a ton of medical and engineering books. I'm also learning how to generate both power (water-driven machinery without electricity for instance) and electricity. I think the best way to ensure my survival is to be able to teach others how to ensure their own. In that regard, information is the only currency that can't collapse and only goes up in value when others do.\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention robotics and automation. Robots will be the workforce eventually and capitalism has no solution to that. Some form of socialism (I know, the evil word) or some novel solution will be required because actual jobs will be gone.
