It seems as if externally expressing my recollection was what brought back all the feelings, or perhaps rather said unleashed the repressed emotional buildup that had accumulated since then. \n\nUpon seeing my reaction, my friend urged me to see a therapist, something that I was pretty skeptical of at first. I couldn't possibly be messed up enough to require professional help, right...? \n\nTurned out that helped a ton, and I grew so much from that help. I ended up developing healthy coping abilities that I use on a daily basis that I'm forever grateful for having learned.
