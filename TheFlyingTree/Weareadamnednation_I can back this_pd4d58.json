The icon we clicked was never really the file. The file is a stream of ones and zeroes somewhere. The trash can isn't a physical thing, it's another model, along with everything else on the screen. If we had to send a stream of ones and zeroes to the processor to describe in detail what it should do with the ones and zeroes of the file, we'd never get anything done.\n\nKnowing everything is a model can give it a sense of hollowness and unreality.
