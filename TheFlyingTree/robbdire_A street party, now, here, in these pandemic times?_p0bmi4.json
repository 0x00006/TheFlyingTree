Well over the past few months, people would bring chairs to the ends of their driveways, and chat in the evenings. This lead to some saying \"we should organise for all of us to come out and have a chat and a drink\" which lead to \"catered street party with bouncy castle for the kids.\"\n\nEvery adult on the street is vaccinated, and the kids have been playing together on the road all summer, so that's a bubble for them as it were, and there are no cases of Covid on the street (nor have there been which is rather nice).\n\nSo yesterday we had a street party.\n\nKids colouring the road in chalk, bouncing on the castle, charging around having fun. Adults chatting, having a few drinks, and food for all. Was awesome and really needed.", "score": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.55, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/p0bmi4/a_street_party_now_here_in_these_pandemic_times/", "id": "p0bmi4", "author": "robbdire", "link_flair_text": "Event", "num_comments": 5, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628414737.0, "comments": [{"author": "DELETED", "id": "h85m4tz", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": null, "submission": "p0bmi4", "stickied": false, "body": "[deleted]", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628418426.0, "parent_id": "t3_p0bmi4", "replies": [{"author": "robbdire", "id": "h85nmo7", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #112", "submission": "p0bmi4", "stickied": false, "body": "It was a simple catered BBQ with just some really nice burgers and sausages and chicken.
