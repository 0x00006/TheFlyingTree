We compete to survive by being \"interesting\" according to criteria that are vaguely defined. Knowing this, we are expected to do two things simultaneously: attempt to create \"interesting\" posts, and ensure those posts meet whichever criteria we were selected for.\n\nSo, since this is a \"microcosm\" we must each represent some fairly unique part of the reddit experience with minimal duplication. I propose a group effort to identify the aspects we represent.\n\n------\n\nTo participate: \nList the subreddits you were active in the week prior to your invitation. Also list the amount of karma on your top post, and the number of posts you made in the week before joining. Metadata will be used to detect unstructured requirements.\n\nIf you don't remember and won't look, don't participate. Invalid data will be culled. \n\nWhat will happen: \nWe use the aggregate data to eliminate over represented groups between us. This narrows us down. We then compare remaining groups to identify trends in the selector.\n\nTEMPLATE - MUST BE FOLLOWED\n\nSubreddits: subreddit1, subreddit2\n\nTopKarma: #####\n\nNumPosts: #####", "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.43, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/oyvpxu/lets_game_the_game/", "id": "oyvpxu", "author": "SuddenProfile", "link_flair_text": "Event", "num_comments": 40, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628210079.0, "comments": [{"author": "Solenya-C137", "id": "h7vvpmx", "score": 7, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #126", "submission": "oyvpxu", "stickied": false, "body": "You don\u2019t have to be interesting.
