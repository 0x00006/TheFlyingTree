{"title": "A theory about many popular \"stupid\" people.", "name": "t3_pfiu1v", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/pfiu1v/a_theory_about_many_popular_stupid_people/", "selftext": "You may have been scrolling through YouTube, Twitter, or other social media and noticed that there are many popular people who are often criticized for being extremely stupid. Some of the ones you may know include the vegan teacher and Nick avocado. My theory (although I'm sure I'm not the first to come up with it) is that these so-called stupid people, are actually quite smart and know exactly what they're doing. I will use the example of the vegan teacher in this discussion. The vegan teacher has radical views that are so out of place that it kind of throws one off (she's radical even for a vegan). I think she makes up these opinions and statements and has all these public freakouts to gather the attention of several commentator channels and other forms of criticizing people. This in turn attracts people to her channel, not because they enjoy her content, but because it's fun to make fun of her. Thing is she's getting all these views on YouTube, and that means that she gets more money. I believe the same is true for Nick avocado, but he went to such a great extent that he'd give up his physical health for the money.\n\nSo what do you think of my theory, do you agree or is it not valid?", "score": 26, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/pfiu1v/a_theory_about_many_popular_stupid_people/", "id": "pfiu1v", "author": "obiwanlenobi", "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "num_comments": 29, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630457151.0, "comments": [{"author": "OccamsRazorstrop", "id": "hb4rcpw", "score": 15, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #180", "submission": "pfiu1v", "stickied": false, "body": "Jerry Lewis, Stan Laurel, all of the Stooges, all of the Marx Brothers, Lou Costello, Marilyn Monroe, Goldie Hawn, and Tracy Morgan: not even close to being a comprehensive list of smart people who laughed all the way to the bank by playing stupid people.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630459031.0, "parent_id": "t3_pfiu1v", "replies": [{"author": "zebediah49", "id": "hb4wip1", "score": 8, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #131", "submission": "pfiu1v", "stickied": false, "body": "Actually stupid people usually make stupid mistakes, and that puts them behind.\n\nSmart people can appear stupid, but evade it.\n\n----\n\nOne of the cleanest examples of this I know of, happening in realtime on video, comes from Bush:\n\n> \"There's an old saying in Tennessee\u2014I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee\u2014that says, 'Fool me once, shame on... shame on you. Fool me\u2014you can't get fooled again.\n\nEveryone probably knows this, but the normal saying is: \"Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.\"  The point is basically victim blaming, but is that if someone scams you, they're a bad person.  However, if you fall for it again, it's kinda your fault for not learning the first time.\n\nSo, this can be taken two ways: (1) this guy that 10 years before was quite a clean debater, making strong intellectual arguments in formal debates, suddenly is a complete idiot that can't remember a standard saying, or --\n(2) he realized halfway through the sentence that he was about to provide a recorded copy of the phrase \"shame on me\".  That's a next-level abusable clip to pull out of context, which was just becoming common at the time (2002) .  I suspect he realized that at the first gap.  At that point, he's searching for a solution, and comes up with a stupid fumble across the second.\n\nThe end result is an awkward \"lol he's so dumb he can't even proverb\".  But it ended there.
