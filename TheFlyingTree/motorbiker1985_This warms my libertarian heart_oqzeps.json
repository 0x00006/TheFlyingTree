Vaccines exist since the 18th century. For most of history the government wasn't involved.\n\nThe fact government stole land and used money extorted from people does not prove it is a good idea.

Because most cities, roads and other infrastructure all over the world was build by using slave labor, every person and every piece of material for anything was moved on infrastructure created by slavery.", "is_submitter": true, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1627207964.0, "parent_id": "t1_h6fck7y", "replies": [{"author": "Walking_the_Cascades", "id": "h6h93sm", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #68", "submission": "oqzeps", "stickied": false, "body": ">Maybe if the government didn't steal money from the working class\n\nOr even better, maybe if the ultra rich paid their fair share. If a minimum wage worker sees one third of their income going to taxes, perhaps we can agree that billionaires could see one half of their wages go to taxes. Or some other percentage that is fair and equitable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>You clearly have no idea how vaccines were made\n\nFor starters, the basis of vaccines rests on the foundations of education. When only the rich can afford education, humanity suffers from all of the real and potential contributions lost by those who couldn't afford private schooling. Hard science research depends on grants which, one one or another, are funded or subsidized by governments. Every wealthy individual or company that provides funding built their wealth in part by using public services, such as ***roads***. I could go on for pages and pages, but perhaps you could point out a single step of the process that has zero reliance on some form of government subsidy. Good luck with that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Do you support slavery? \n\nSpeaking of slavery (of which I am very much opposed to), without any government there are no laws, so your apparent position that no government is the best government supports a community with no laws. Street gangs and robber barons rise to the top as there is no mechanism to stop them. Welcome back child labor and slavery.\n\nThere are a lot of things about the current US government of which I disapprove. It's quite possible, and perhaps even probable, that you and I agree on more than we disagree. But I've yet to hear any Libertarian *solutions* that seem tenable.  Simply not paying taxes may work for you as an individual, but it only shifts more tax burden on the rest of us and doesn't address solutions for a better functioning society.\n\nEdit: Added a quote.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1627224821.0, "parent_id": "t1_h6gl0eb", "replies": [{"author": "motorbiker1985", "id": "h6hekun", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "", "submission": "oqzeps", "stickied": false, "body": "Do you understand that it is the ultra rich controlling the government which they use to regulate the market, destroy their competition of small businesses and getting away with not paying taxes, right? The complete opposite of a free market. Get rid of the government and let the the ultra rich will lose.\n\nAgain, the poor are poor because the government is blocking them. Public schools are quite useless and even the poor pay a lot of money in taxes. Let them keep the money and they will have funds for their kids education.\n\nSlavery can only be legal in places where government makes it legal. Slavery violates the NAP, so it can not exist in an anarchocapitalist or libertarian society. My point about slavery was to show the flaw of your logic about private roads only existing because of public roads. Well, a lot of medicine only exists because of nazi and Japanese government experiments on humans. Some of it only exists because of US government experiments on black people. That is no argument for government being in charge of medicine. A lot of infrastructure in the USA exists because of a genocide of the natives.\n\nMonopolies can also only exist in regulated markets, there are no monopolies in an open market.", "is_submitter": true, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1627227634.0, "parent_id": "t1_h6h93sm", "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"author": "toychristopher", "id": "h6fzmli", "score": 3, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #177", "submission": "oqzeps", "stickied": false, "body": "You blame public ownership, I blame selfish people deliberately sabotaging our government so they can exploit others and profit.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1627189380.0, "parent_id": "t1_h6f3i1q", "replies": [{"author": "motorbiker1985", "id": "h6glmdr", "score": -1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "", "submission": "oqzeps", "stickied": false, "body": "Those selfish thieves would not be able to steal if the money could be allocated by parents.
