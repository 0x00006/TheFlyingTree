But just in the chance your still unclear I'll put it this way:\n\nIn WW2 the Germans were trying to figure out how to improve their airplanes.  They looked at the damage on the planes that came back and saw holes in the wings.  They thought, well gosh, we should armor the wings then since apparently that's where we're getting shot the most.\n\nThe problem is they were only looking at the planes *that made it back.*  They never got to see where the damage is on the planes that *didn't* make it back.  They ended up reinforcing the wings even though actually, the wings were already sturdy enough to take a few shots (hence why they made it back) however the shots to the fuselage was going through and hitting important vitals like fuel or the pilot.\n\nNow technically this is a different fallacy, but it's the same concept.  They were working with a data set that was incomplete, and the cognitive bias blinded them to the other side of the data they were missing.  It seemed like they were making  a rational decision, but actually they were falling victim to a form of confirmation bias.\n\nSame thing here with our conversation:  You see the data points of the show demonstrating captains disobeying the Directive.  You make a seemingly rational conclusion that no one follows it.  However what you don't see are the overwhelming majority of times the Directive is upheld just off screen.  Your data set is victim of a bias and so your conclusions isn't drawing from a set of data that is representative of the reality, it's only representative of the instances that are most interesting (hence why the writers included it).  The moments you see are exceptions, not the rule.
