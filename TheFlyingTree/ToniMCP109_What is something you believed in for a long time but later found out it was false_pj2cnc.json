All creation stories are pretty wild -- read Greek, Norse, Native American, or nearly any other. To expand on these three, in the Greek, Cronus removes the manhood of his father, which then transforms into the goddess of sexual desire, Aphrodite. He then proceeds to swallow five of his children whole; in the Norse, the world effectively begins from a cow licking a block of ice; in the Native American (Maidu, is what I'm referencing) a turtle dives down to find a marble size piece of mud that becomes the entire mass of the Earth. I'll come back to Greek in a second.\n\nThere are two primary functions of mythology: 1) To explain why and how we all got here and 2) To encapsulate the cultural values of the society.\n\nIt seems as if Greek, unsurprisingly, shares the most similarity with Christianity. Pandora, the first woman, is created as punishment for man. Eve is created from a piece of Adam and ultimately leads him to temptation. As /u/celtic_cuchulainn mentions, this indicates subservience. Woman means \"of man\" as stated in the Bible.\n\nI'm replying to your comment assuming \"the point\" you're referring to is a point of literary significance, which is how I read stories of myth such as the Bible.
