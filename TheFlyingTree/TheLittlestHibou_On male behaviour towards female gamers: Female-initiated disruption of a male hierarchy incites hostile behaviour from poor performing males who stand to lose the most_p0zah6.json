They observed for example that white women during the time of the time of the suffrage movement were very susceptible for racist rhetoric. The idea is that when you have all these hierarchies intersecting there will always be someone who has a lower standing than you to shit on and feel superior about. Even though both are oppressed and working together would be much more effective at liberating them. It\u2018s a kind of substitude for the real fight, one they can win easily. You can also see this within oppressed groups as they gain more acceptance and thus power. You can see it with misogynistic gay men and transphobic lesbians, or with rich black men classist towards the poor.\n\nOf course the answer of intersectional feminism to this problem is solidarity. The recognition that we are much more effective in liberating people if we stop tearing each other down and stand with each other. It\u2018s a mindset and a responsibility of the environment to set up the right atmosphere. When instead of fighting each other we change the conditions that keep all of us down. \n\nA great example of this is when English [LGBT people](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesbians_and_Gays_Support_the_Miners) stood together with the coal miners in the 80s. Miners used to be a very homophobic demographic. But because they were helped by these gay men and lesbians they came to empathize with each other\u2018s struggles.

And combined I had about 1200 people hating on me over gossip and just coming along for the ride. Doxxing wasn't a word yet but that is what happened including a petition to have me fired for picking on the modder (despite the fact he had posts on modding forums saying that he was trying to see how far he can go before being banned, and an admin banned him) and the petition had over 850 signatures, over a lie.  \n\n\n Some people got my e-mail (it was a hotmail so pretty anonymous or so I thought) and I was taking a 3D animation course because I was interested in working there but in the class we communicated with MS Messenger and the trolls got in and they would post in bright pink things like \"FUCK YOU CUNT MODERATOR I HOPE YOU GET RAPED AND DIE\" and very graphic death threats (that were more disturbing because you knew the little asshat was 14 and it made it worse because they were babies typing this shit), this sort of thing was daily and it was embarrassing when I was having my piece critiqued and the messages would come up on the bug screen in front of the class, luckily they were very understanding about this.   \n\n\nNothing like this happened to any of the male moderators, BTW. That guy didn't think any of the male mods were preventing him from being a moderator, the modder didn't think a male banned him for his provocative post, he just assumed I was a prude and hated looking at \"realistic bouncing boobs\" (they were realistic at all they looked like semi-deflated saline bags sloshing around on that woman's chest- looked painful haha, but that wasn't for me to give a shit about lol).  \n\n\nAnyway the rape threats started appearing in my mail box... in note form (and sometimes on my windshield of my car) my physical one of my house.

(BTW that guy made over 20 sock puppet accounts that messaged me and telling me to stop picking on him, they were supposed to be girls so he made them talk like anime bimbos, it was pretty funny and I could see his IP address. :D  \n\n\nSo yeah....
