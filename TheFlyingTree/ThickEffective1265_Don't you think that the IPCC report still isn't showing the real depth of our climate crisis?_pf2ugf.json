And these models comprise some set of parameters, based on what we know of how the real world works.  What I have observed, based on conversation with climate people over the years and on some of the things they write, is that when building any such model, you are inevitably going to run into parameters whose values you just don't know.  An average layperson like me wouldn't have any idea what to put for such a value.  We wouldn't even begin to know what kind of range to expect.  That is where scientific expertise comes into play.  Someone who has spent their life studying the interactions of various factors in real world climate data actually is going to have an idea of what to put there.\n\nThis requires a certain degree of scientific intuition.  That is ubiquitous in science.  All good researchers have that, and use it.  But here's the thing.  Scientific intuition is honed from years of experience -- *past* experience.  With past data.  So if we're all climate researchers and we all get together at some conference, one of the things we're going to talk about is what kind of estimates we're all making.  Maybe you think that when it comes to hoosgowgaskets per hectare -- a vital parameter for modeling the climate -- a reasonable range of values is between 100 and 150.  Maybe I, far more radical, argue that a reasonable range is between 250 and 750 hph.  Both of us base our estimates on our own intuition, honed from years of experience studying hoosegogasketry in nature and in the archeological record.\n\nSo we have this big debate, you end up creating your model, I end up creating my model, and maybe there are some other various models.  And collectively we all look at all the models, and we all say together, well, we don't all completely agree on the exact details, but at least we now have a range of possible outcomes, from the cautious estimate to the \"runaway hoosegowgasketry\" model on the other end.  From those models we distill a range of expected outcomes:  average sea levels will rise 5cm in the next century.  Or they will rise 10cm.  Or maybe 20cm.\n\nBut as Cate Blanchett once said... we are all of us deceived.\n\nThe problem is that nothing during the past 50 million years has ever come close to what is going on with the Earth right now.  Our intuitions are all out of date, because our experience of the past is inadequate to the scale of change today.  What happens is that over the next few years, some new hoosegowgasket data comes in, and we see that the actual hph value has gone from 50, to 500, to 1500.  All of our estimates were blown.  We all try to regroup and adjust our models... now we're saying maybe 50cm in a century, maybe 100cm.\n\nBut we're still just reacting, still making estimates based on past experience.  So we are going to make the same mistake again, and again.  In a sense, you can see it as a more subtle version of what many laypeople experience when trying to grasp the magnitude of what is happening around them.  They can't.  The most emotionally vulnerable retreat into complete denial.  Scientists aren't denialists, but they too struggle to adjust to the scale of the calamity.\n\nSo my hypothesis is that this phenomenon, of climate estimates being inadequate, will persist until an entire generation of climate scientists comes of age in the time of great change, whose expertise is thoroughly \"at home\" with the calamity.\n\nIn the meantime, you should probably mentally exaggerate every estimate they publish.  Eventually they will catch up.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630416676.0, "parent_id": "t3_pf2ugf", "replies": [{"author": "plasma_phys", "id": "hb29s46", "score": 4, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #111", "submission": "pf2ugf", "stickied": false, "body": "This is a good post, but wanted to chime in and say that computational physicists do have tools to combat this - uncertainty quantification and/or uncertainty analysis. Put simply, if a parameter in a model is uncertain, one can run an ensemble of simulations for many values of that parameter and, using some fun math, determine the sensitivity of the model to the parameter. If you sample the values of the parameter from a normal or long-tailed distribution, you're going to be including not just the \"reasonable\" values, but also completely unreasonable ones (which may or may not be more realistic). No best-practices model would be using hand-tuned parameters without UQ.\n\nAre these tools always used? Nope! But a quick Google scholar search immediately pulls up a half dozen review papers on uncertainty analysis in climate modeling, so I wouldn't be surprised if the field is well aware of such pitfalls already.

E.g. we don't know how much methane is in the deap sea. We don't know how much of it might get released due to the increasing acidity of the oceans (CO2 in water forms carbonic acid).

And the bias is almost all in one direction.  I can think of only a very few cases where some factor in climate dynamics was changing more slowly than the models predicted.  It's overwhelmingly the other way.\n\nSo is this a \"methods\" issue?  Are people culturally not open to the information that systematic bias analysis can provide?

Anecdotally at least, I have observed a lot of resistance to UQ and updating assumptions in my own field. UQ is new enough (not widely used in the big fusion research programs until about a decade ago) that many people simply don't know anything about it, and either ignore it or downplay its usefulness. If you've been modeling fusion plasma for 50 years and continuously matching experiments to within experimental error, why would you bother learning new mathematics to quantify model error? However, modeling for fusion is, relative to climate modeling, low stakes! There's very little incentive to update assumptions on model parameters when you're, say, modeling a machine that won't have first plasma until 2025.\n\nClimate modelers, however, have every incentive to get things right. Climate is easier to observe than an experiment that doesn't exist yet! As an outsider looking in, my impression is that many of the climate modeling misses in the past few decades have indeed been missed physics.
