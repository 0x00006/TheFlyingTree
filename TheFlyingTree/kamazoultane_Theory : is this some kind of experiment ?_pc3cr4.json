I was suprised but I was like \"yeah ok maybe they want to create an ultimate subreddit\" (sorry for my bad english).\nThe thing is that I got added after having posted on r/intj. I have also remarked that a lot of people were coming also from mbti subreddits. My theory is we were sent to a special \"system\" (idk if that's the english word for it. Understand by that a sort of microcosm for experiments. When we isolate some factors to prove something.) and, as we have posted on mbti subreddits,we can be,in some way, classified accprding to our *supposed* behaviour (mbti isn't really that good to classify persons.. but it is well known by people so it is easier to find persons for this supposed experiment) . So are you coming also from mbti subreddits ?  Is this some coincidence and I am just being stupid ?\n\nIdk but at least I won't be kicked out of the subreddit because I didn't post XD. \n\n(No really what is the purpose of this sub ?)", "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.64, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/pc3cr4/theory_is_this_some_kind_of_experiment/", "id": "pc3cr4", "author": "kamazoultane", "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "num_comments": 28, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629996281.0, "comments": [{"author": "IsNowReallyTheTime", "id": "hag2g8k", "score": 9, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #220", "submission": "pc3cr4", "stickied": false, "body": "The rest of Reddit is an experiment.

That being said I believe I posted on the INTP (I don't frequent there often since it seems to be a circle jerk of enabling behavior so it was a rare occurrence) before getting the invite.\n\nIt's not made readily clear but you don't need to post a new post weekly or at all to remain, only comment at the very least (although I think most new saplings do so, myself included, as it's not plainly spelled out). \n\nI wager it's an experiment of some sort, perhaps to highlight the inclination of humans to flock toward and remain within special collections that are inclusive of specific \"chosen\" individuals, even if there is a toll of some sort otherwise a penalty will be enacted that will remove them from said position (post or get kicked)... we're not a cult but... I mean... Also the only real benefit of staying is to be included in an exclusive group with chances to rise in an arbitrary rank.  If you want to karma farm this isn't the place as upvotes aren't really given much (so I've noticed, especially in comparison to other subs), so it doesn't seem to reward reposts/shitposting for views, but rather just having conversations (barring the posts made by some initiates initially).  Or I'm reading way too much into it and its just a shits-n-giggles group that took off.\n\nFor me the reason I stayed is it seemed like an interesting experience/experiment so I'm sticking around for now and see how it pans out.  I figured it might give me an opportunity to interact with users I might not get a chance otherwise to do so due to the subs I frequent and may offer a chance to view other perspectives.\n\nEdit: Spelling.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629998029.0, "parent_id": "t3_pc3cr4", "replies": [{"author": "kamazoultane", "id": "hag69f6", "score": 3, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #251", "submission": "pc3cr4", "stickied": false, "body": "Thx a lot.
