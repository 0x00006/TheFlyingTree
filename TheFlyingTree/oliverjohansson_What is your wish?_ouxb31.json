That's why you don't see mastodons and mammoths and saber toothed cats and North American cheetahs (responsible for the evolutionary arms race that led to pronghorns that can run 60 mph) and giant ground sloths and numerous other species that we killed when we came to the Americas 15 or 17 thousand years ago.\n\nThat's also why you don't see moas and Haast's eagles on New Zealand.\n\n[Holocene Extinction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_extinction)\n\n> if you whipped out humans, and another species evolved instead, what you wish for would not necessarily be retained\n\nI'm not sure there has ever before been a case of a single multicellular species causing such a mass extinction of other multicellular creatures.
