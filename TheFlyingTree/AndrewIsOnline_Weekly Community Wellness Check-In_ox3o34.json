Nothing like growing your own food. \n\nHad to check what a Marionberry was and I jumped into a wiki hole. Apparently it's the most common cultivar of blackberry, developed by the USDA Agricultural Research Service in the mid/late 40s and released to the public in the 50s after being test grown in by Oregon State Uni in Marion county, hence the name. In 09, Oregon tried to make it the state berry, but a farmer in the Oregon Blackberry and Raspberry commission delayed it, despite it receiving 90 votes, saying that the Marionberry was vastly more popular than the Kotata cultivar he was growing and that sales would increase the popularity further thus reducing sales of other varieties. The Marionberry appears to be the current state berry, however. Scandalous.
