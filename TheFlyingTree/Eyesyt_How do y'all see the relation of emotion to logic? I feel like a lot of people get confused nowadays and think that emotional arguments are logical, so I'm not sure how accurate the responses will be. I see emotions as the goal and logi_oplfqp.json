In contrast, the Damasio proposes that emotions play a critical role in the ability to make fast, rational decisions in complex and uncertain situations.\n> \n> Patients with frontal lobe damage, such as Phineas Gage, provided the first evidence that the frontal lobes were associated with decision-making. Frontal lobe damage, particularly to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), results in impaired abilities to organize and plan behavior and learn from previous mistakes, without affecting intellect in terms of working memory, attention, and language comprehension and expression.\n> \n> vmPFC patients also have difficulty expressing and experiencing appropriate emotions.

I work in this field, so maybe this perspective will help: \n\nWe have brains because we need to make sense of our environment and behave in ways that promote survival and multiplication. The more elaborate the behaviour of an animal, the better chances for survival, the better adaptations. Example: ever saw insects going for the light at night? That's because for 412m years going toward the light is how you get out of a tree trunk. 200 years of artificial light and this adaptation shows its limitation. Insect behaviour in this case is instinctual. \n\nWanna get better? You need a feedback loop that registers in a memory (yes, that's learning) and a shortcut that tells you how to behave in a certain situation. the next level of sophistication over instinct is emotion. Emotions are like some little apps that tell us how to behave. Example: do you meet an obstacle between you and something that could satisfy your needs? No need to think too much, anger will tell you what to do - destroy the obstacle. \n\nEmotions and affect, together with memory and learning, generate much more complex behaviours. Can we do even better? Yes. Entering cognition. Rationality. Logic. Cognition is the 3rd later of complexity for generating behaviour. So now instead of just ANGER -> HULK SMASH, you can have more nuanced behavioural responses that help you improve the chances for achieving your goals. So instead of attempting to destroy the obstacle, when you feel anger you can learn to figure out ways to avoid the obstacle altogether. Or to disassemble it and make it easier to remove. \n\nAll decisions, all behaviours, all arguments are based on emotions. If we don't feel anything about something, we're not really going to do anything about it. Our rational / cognitive layer helps us execute more effectively on the push the emotion provides us with. So instead of yelling at one another, we can have a calm conversation and be assertive.

First of all what you call emotion and logic probably should be split up.\n\nAn argument has three things: Premises, logic, and a conclusion.\n\nThe premises are things you have to assume to make your argument. Like \"a rock falls to the ground when I drop it\" or \"self-determination is a human right\". As you can see there are two types of premises: descriptive and normative.\nNormative premises are \"ought to\" statements. Descriptive premises are observations or statements of \"fact\".\n\nIf you have a bunch of premises you can use logic to derive statements from them. Logic comes in many forms, the main ones being deduction and induction. Logic without premises is useless. And the following rule applies: If you logically combine premises of the same type, the conclusion will also have that type. But if you have one prescriptive premise, the conclusion is always prescriptive.\n\nA conclusion then is a statement that you arrive at by applying logic to premises. If the conclusion does not follow logically from the premises that\u2018s an error and an invalid argument.\n\nTo get back to the point: \"Feelings\" can either mean that your conclusion does not follow from your premises (irrationality) or that you made a normative claim. Making normative claims is fine. You can argue based on moral claims. But your logic has to be sound and the conclusion has to follow for it to be a valid argument.\n\nLikewise when people say logic they generally mean either that something is only based on descriptive claims or that the conclusion must be logically sound. The first one is ridiculous, we\u2018d get nowhere without normative claims. The second one is true. Arguments have to be sound.\n\nI hate how people adopt the optics of rational debate without actually educating themselves. So many \"debate people\" or \"logic fetishizers\" make a lot of descriptive claims, but then their conclusion doesn\u2018t follow from that at all. Or even worse, they hide normative assumptions they need to make to make their argument work, and then pretend their conclusion is descriptive (a category error which is a logical fallacy). You can absolutely make normative claims, but you should be clear about them for good faith. \n\nThe worst offender of this kind of prescriptive-descriptive error has to be Benny Shapiro. He\u2018d fail an introductory philosophy course with that kind of argumentation.\n\nIt stems from a lack of philosophical fundamentals. \"Facts vs feelings\" is the wrong question to ask. We should absolutely reject unsound arguments (sneaky normative claim based on nothing. I hope someone finds that amusing).
