It is better to think about it as a form of engineering, though most engineers would reject this idea, if only because most engineers do not know what it means to be an engineer.\n\nTo describe in a generic sense, engineering is the discipline of designing and building models of distinct modules. Each module in the model has some encompassing property of function and means by which that function can be integrated into the performance of the system.\n\nWith this lofty definition it is easier to see that engineering is reductionist in nature. A model is a representation, not the particular. As is true with all forms of engineering, the model is just a model, it is not that which it represents. I could elaborate ad-nauseum, but I won't because I'm at work.\n\nNow I can make my point: Any sort of personality type theory is going to be a sort of model. Models can be useful in making predictions *within the context of the model*, and reducing the complexity of reality to just the particulars pertinent to some objective. Personality type theory can make better-than-chance predictions of someones behavior, and this is provably true.\n\nWhether or not Myers Briggs' personality type theory in particular makes better-than-chance predictions I haven't cared to know. Regardless, a personality type theory can be of utility. What it cannot do is give you more information than the model allows. It is reductionist by virtue of being a model, it can't tell you anything about yourself outside of the scope of the model.\n\nNever confuse a model of a thing for the thing represented by that model.\n\nIts like in hokey crime shows where there is some blurry digital image and someone says \"enhance\" and by some means that can only be magic the computer is able to pull out of nothing more information than was encoded in the image file. The image is a model; as such, it only contains incomplete information that has been reduced such that it can fit within the model.\n\nWith all that said I think that some personality type theories can make useful predictions, but these predictions are only predictions *within the model*. You can interpolate to your hearts content and it will be consistent with the model, but there is no way of knowing if it is consistent with reality. Personality type models are dangerously alluring to those that would rather abuse the system to make all sorts of non-scientific extrapolations and dangerous inferences that are just not possible to do within such a limited model.\n\n\"\n\nI think this gets at what is being talked about with pigeonholing. A model, which is a leaky abstraction by nature, is being confused for what it represents.
