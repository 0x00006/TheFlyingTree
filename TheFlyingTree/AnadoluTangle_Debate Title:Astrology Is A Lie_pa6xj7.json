{"title": "Debate Title:Astrology Is A Lie", "name": "t3_pa6xj7", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/pa6xj7/debate_titleastrology_is_a_lie/", "selftext": "I really don't think astrology is more than a fantasy because it has no scienctific explanation unless you believe in Karma.Okay,there is Relativity Theory but my point still stands.Even if we get effected by all the things happening in the universe,why would I fall in love or gain money just because Mars moves a bit more different than usual?\n\n\nMyers-Briggs Type Indicator on the other hand,is at least somewhat related to sociology and psychology.For example you don't be an INTJ because you're born in march.There are certain cognitive functions which determines majority of your personality type.\n\nMy meaning by 'the majority of your personality type' is your functions' usage in your brain and behaviour.Now,let me explain the topic briefly.\n\nThe first letter of your personality is either E,which stands for extroverted or I,which stands for introverted as you can guess.\n\nSecond,there is intuition and sensing.Now,things get a bit complex here.Your intuition or sensing will be examined in two branches:Introverted and Extroverted. For example,INTJ type uses the Ni function,which stands for Introverted intuition,while INTP personality uses Ne,which stands for Extroverted intuition.Same goes for sensing as well.\n\nTo put more bluntly,intuition is more about thinking while sensing is more about your five senses.\n\nAfter that,we come to the infamous thinker-feeler conflict.The same rules for the second letter goes for this too.T stands for thinking.Thinkers are more likely to decide with their logic,while feelers are more likely to decide with their feelings.\n\nAlso,thinkers may slam the bitter truth on your face somtimes,unlike feelers.\n\nAnd the latest letter decides either you're a lazy prick or a hardworking person-nah,just kidding.\n\nP stands for percieving.Percievers are more likely to procrastinate.The most significant examples for this are ENTP and ENFP personality types.\n\nBack on the last letter,J stands for judging.Judgers are more likely to get things done in time instead of procrastinating.\n\nThat's all,I hope I could enlight you.Although this is not the most detailed explanation,it's still enough for new people to learn the basics.\n\nPlease keep the comment section civilized.This post is made for debating,not swearing at each other.\n\n\n*I can sense the hellfire that will rage in the comments.*", "score": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.74, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/pa6xj7/debate_titleastrology_is_a_lie/", "id": "pa6xj7", "author": "AnadoluTangle", "link_flair_text": "Debate", "num_comments": 112, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1629746784.0, "comments": [{"author": "Cognizant_Psyche", "id": "ha2p7vk", "score": 16, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #151 | Ordo Cognitus", "submission": "pa6xj7", "stickied": false, "body": "Astrology is to Astronomy what Alchemy is to Chemistry - a stepping stone and bridge from superstition to science.\n\n*That is unless you are in a Wuxia Cultivation World or the Elric Brothers... then it's crazy powerful and real.*\n\nAs far as the Myer-Briggs stuff, I think it is a useful self-analyzing tool to discover potential flaws and thought processes about yourself to help correct and improve them.

Whether it\u2019s the \u201cinvisible\u201d blind spots caused by the positioning of optical nerves or reasoning that is held despite the lack of rationality, our brains convincingly portray fiction as reality all the time. We see faces in the clouds, messages in mud and meaning in dreams. The concept of days and months are illusions. No month ever repeats itself. Nothing in nature cares what \u201cMonday\u201d is. We like repetition because helps us feel more confident and in control of the events and circumstances that are very much not. Perhaps the moon\u2019s phase affects us due to its gravitational affect, or it\u2019s brilliance. But no, there\u2019s absolutely no rationality in horoscopes. Anything vague enough can be rationalized without much effort. \n\nAs far as Meyers Briggs, it\u2019s hopelessly flawed as well. Sure, there are probably some aspects of its assertions that could be argued as reasonable, but the majority of it falls within the same premise as horoscopes. If it\u2019s vague enough, it can be rationalized. However, when you look at what the definitions are of the categories, it becomes apparent that we have no real way of measuring exactly where an individual falls within a category. For example, what is the line between an introvert person and an extrovert? When someone is closer to a combination of the two, what defining quality is pointed to as the deciding factor? Personality and preference are fluid. Most likely, any of us could name a number of things that have changed about us in the last 5+ years. There would be more in the last 10 or 15 or more. \n\nThe fact is, as much as we like the feeling, very few if any personality titles hold more weight than the quizzes we see that tell us which kind of bread we are. \n\nI think becoming more introspective and self-confident is a good alternative for the perceived benefits these kinds of tests provide.
