She feels like she only gets it when she sleeps on her back, so she's scared to sleep on her back.\n\nUm, (this is from a combination of studying psychology in college decades ago and research due to my mother)...my understanding is it's basically something going wrong with your sleep cycle and consciousness. When you sleep, you go through different stages, and in the heavier stages of sleep you actually are not usually able to move and are not usually conscious or aware. But people with sleep paralysis ***are*** conscious/aware in some sense during these stages at times. Basically, everyone experiences \"sleep paralysis,\" but none of us is supposed to know. People who think they're the only ones who experience it just happen to wake up during stages of sleep when we're not supposed to.\n\nMy mother does not follow a normal/set sleep schedule, and it is thought that this and/or sleep apnea can cause this. My mother also has anxiety, and I wonder if this could have anything to do with it because of her brain never fully \"shutting off,\" i.e. is she just always conscious on some level.

It's sort of the opposite glitch to sleepwalking. \n\nYour brain has systems to prevent your body from moving while you dream. In sleepwalking, these systems fail, and you end up in a non-coherent mobile state while your conscious mind is disconnected from the world around you. You could consider it that your body is awake while your mind is asleep\n\nSleep paralysis is the opposite.
