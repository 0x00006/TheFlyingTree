So, there is almost certainly real bias against religion here.\n\n> Whether you believe in God or not, the Bible is a good book (or strictly compilation of books).\n\nI'm curious. Have you ever sat down and started reading it from the beginning?\n\nI read the Pentateuch (first 5 books) some decades ago. Despite some major plot points, an angry god destroying the entire world by flood and nuking two cities and ordering at least 7 genocides, father-daughter incest, slavery including capturing of sex slaves, rape (both as a crime and as a path to marriage), alcohol abuse, etc., etc., etc., I was amazed that my early iron age ancestors were able to make the book just plain boring!\n\nIn my opinion, the book is horribly written with poor character development. Mostly, I never cared whether any given character lived or died. Few of the characters are good in any way at all.\n\nStarting with Adam and Eve, it's a story where God demands ignorance over knowledge. Abraham himself is a character who is willing to haggle with God over the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah but will not stand up to either God or Sarah to defend either of his children.\n\nMoses is an absolutely monstrous human being commanding war crimes sometimes in God's name, sometimes just because he himself said so.\n\n> It is interesting from a historical point of view. It does teach a consistent theme throughout, but at a lot of times it's hard to see that on the surface. Which is why the Gospel parts are the best, it's clear and to the point.\n\nI'm not actually sure that the gospels make things any better. First, Jesus himself reasserted the validity of the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible/Old Testament) in its entirety (Matt 5:17-18). And, no, he did not fulfill anything in those passages that say that the O.T. is in effect until the earth disappears and everything is accomplished, which is clearly not the case.\n\nJesus said some nice things (e.g. \"that which you do for the least of us\", \"turn the other cheek\", \"love thy neighbor\", etc.). But, he also said some horrific things (Matt 10:34-36, Ephesians 6:5, Colossians 4:1 -- asserting that all Christians are slaves, Luke 22:36, etc.) Worst of all, Jesus had a kill list! (Luke 19:27)\n\nSo, what exactly do you see as the consistent message from this book? It seems to reinforce the RPM strategy of warfare that was common at the time. (RPM == Rape, Pillage, Murder)\n\n> If you're not interested in religion or God, it contains a lot of stories of power and civilization from thousands of years ago.\n\nYes. But, how many of them are actually true? The entirety of the Exodus never happened. The Hebrew people were never enslaved in large numbers in Egypt. Pharaoh's economy wasn't even largely slave-based. Sure, there were slaves. But, it wasn't the foundation of the economy the way it was in the U.S. southern states. And, Moses is not considered to be a historical figure at all. That seems to undercut the idea that God gave the 10 commandments to Moses on Mount Sinai.\n\nSo, how much of what happened in the Bible is real?\n\n> We will ultimately argue until the cows come home on what is the best book, but the Bible has to be a contender.\n\nFor its influence on the world and the massive harm it has caused, including crusades, inquisitions, the doctrine of manifest destiny and associated genocides of indigenous peoples, the biblical justification of the transatlantic slave trade, the doctrine of Deicide and associated perpetuation of severe antisemitism, pogroms, clinic bombings, doctor shootings, etc., sure.

It's teaching the importance of investing the gifts bestowed upon you - and the fundamental teaching point of Abrahamic religions: ultimately there will be a judgement, those who have squandered their human lives will not receive entry into Heaven.\n\nSo, by your own interpretation, rather than Jesus having others slaughter people at his feet, Jesus is saying that those people will not receive the respite of death. Instead, they will be tortured in Hell for all eternity.\n\nAre you sure that this context makes the message better?\n\nI think it's orders of magnitude worse, infinitely worse even, to mete out infinite punishment for finite crimes.\n\nThis is one of the reasons I find that Yahweh/God/Jesus actually got worse, not better in the New Testament.\n\n> Whether that's something that interests you or not is by-the-by. The story is also contextual to the society of the time, where people could be killed for what we today would see as an outrageous reason. The story was thus to illustrate a point in a way the people at the time could resonate with.\n\nThat's fine. Just remember, instead of Jesus merely killing people, your interpretation of the parable means that Jesus will be torturing these people for eternity. [There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.](https://bible.knowing-jesus.com/topics/Gnashing-Of-Teeth)\n\n> By taking one line from it, and suggesting that it's possibly Jesus' teaching on how we should act is complete rubbish and really my main point.\n\nThe problem is that by your interpretation, that one verse is made much much worse.\n\n> There is evil in this world, saying you follow a religion doesn't change that and doesn't stop people from doing evil things. A book preaching that we shouldn't be evil isn't the reason for people doing evil things, but like everything else, can be used by people to justify their actions.\n\nSo, why isn't the Bible a clearer message that can't be used in this way? Why would there be so many serious contradictions that allow people to read any message they want from the book?\n\n> If it wasn't the Bible, it would something else.\n\nIt might be. We're certainly a violent and xenophobic species. The problem is that any form of sectarianism by its very definition divides us up into sects of Us and Them, even when the reality is that we're all just us.\n\n> At least with the Bible we can go \"um, er, no, you've got that wrong, look\".\n\nWell, no you can't. Because the other side can say the same to you by pointing to other passages that contradict the ones you like.\n\nDo I cherry pick the bad bits from the Bible to make my points? Yes.\n\nDo you cherry pick the good bits from the Bible to make your points? Yes.\n\nThe reality is that there isn't a consistent message from a book written over centuries by many different authors with different purposes.\n\nHow do you even know which bits to cherry pick to make your points? Aren't you just applying your own pre-existing morality to your reading of the Bible to know which bits to ignore and which bits to highlight?\n\n> If you want to get a view of the main point of the Bible you can look at what Jesus said on the greatest commands (Matthew 22:34 for context):\n\n>> Jesus replied: \"Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: Love your neighbor as yourself. All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.\"\n\nThis is a very subtly evil quote.\n\nTranslation: Love other people. But, always love me more.\n\nThis is God's [malignant narcissism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignant_narcissism) on full display. Love me. Love me. Me Me Me! Always me first.\n\nAnd, what if you love other people but don't love God? Well,  I guess furnace of fire is the only alternative.\n\n> The Bible is broadly split into: the history of the people of Israel\n\nYou are aware, I hope, that historians generally agree that The Exodus never happened, the Hebrews were never enslaved in large numbers in Egypt, and that Moses is a myth or legend rather than a historical figure.\n\nSo, this isn't really the history of Israel in the most important aspect of all.\n\n> the lead up and pointing towards the Messiah\n\nThe messiah who will bring world peace within his own lifetime, not one who will need a mulligan. [Jesus did not even *want* to bring peace.](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+10%3A34-36&version=NRSV)\n\n> the fulfilment of the prophecy with Jesus\n\nJews of the time were correct to reject Jesus's claim to be the messiah. He failed to fulfill the Jewish prophesies. [Jews today still reject his claim for the same reasons.](https://www.aish.com/jw/s/48892792.html)\n\nHe did not bring peace. He did not rebuild the temple.

Whether your or my interpretation of it is correct or not is largely academic, it'll either be as described, not, or something entirely different.  The New Testament came about when the 'fact' that your salvation is required is well established.  What it exists for, is to provide you with a way to be saved.\n\nWhat you're doing here is reading Jesus' message as \"If you don't do as I say, I'll push you off a cliff\", when the message is \"You're about to fall off a cliff, take my hand\".\n\nYou answer your own question with why isn't it written better.

When in reality, there are only a few direct quotes from God (ten commandments and Jesus being prime examples).  But it's also worth stressing that very little of the Bible is made up of instructions (as I'm sure you're well aware).\n\nAnd whilst this is rapidly moving into theological debate rather than whether The Bible is a candidate for \"best book of all time\"... You're quite right on the character of God, it's spelled out in the Ten Commandments: \"I the Lord your God am a jealous God\".  But also, I'm not entirely sure the relevancy.  God is not a politician looking for the popular vote, God is (allegedly) the creator of our souls and the Universe in which we live, 'dem the rules', so to speak.  But hold that up to what Christianity is actually asking you to do: don't be shit to each other, don't fall into the trappings of worldly possessions (probably because you land up being shit to others), and don't conjure up anything else to worship - not really all  that bad IMHO.\n\nJews today of course reject Jesus as the Messiah, otherwise they would be Christians.\n\nChristian teaching is that the temple was rebuilt as Jesus stated, in three days.  The temple was though himself, God incarnate, through the resurrection.  Which lead to the curtain being torn in the temple, showing that access to God is not to be contained to only a priest etc.  But again this is getting heavily into theological debate and as a pretty poor Christian I'm probably not the going to be the person who can definitively answer your questions.\n\nBut I stand by my assertion that The Bible should be considered one of the best books of all time, I guess even based on the level of debate it's created through such a long period - nothing else has come close to that level of influence.  As to whether you're a personal believer or feel that the world might have been a better place without it doesn't really change that.  I think the heavy down votes on my post really highlight more of an anti-theist sentiment rather than a genuine disagreement of my suggestion. \n\nAs a casual Christian, I'm not out to convert anybody or preach to anybody - you are clearly vigorously anti-religion and I don't think anything I will say will change any of that view.  I do hope you take one thing from our conversation, that there may be an alternative way of reading the Bible that you have not previously considered.  I will also happily stand up and say I haven't read the entire thing, nowhere near, I also don't think it's entirely necessary, there is plenty in there which I think even the most academic of followers have a hard time to finding the relevancy of in today's world (like, most of Numbers), but maybe that's more interesting to those trying to get an understanding of the people of the time.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1627326325.0, "parent_id": "t1_h6lgcj9", "replies": [{"author": "MisanthropicScott", "id": "h6oomen", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Druid #6 | Ordo Cognitus", "submission": "onwaa1", "stickied": false, "body": "> I think you're reading the Bible as if you'd read a fantasy book...\n\nNot exactly. When I read Tolkien, I suspend disbelief. I don't read it as if anyone actually believes the story. And, I find the excellent character development and incredibly detailed description of the fictional world to be highly entertaining.\n\nDecades ago, I tried to read the Bible. I did get all the way through the Pentateuch. There were massively interesting (if unpleasant) plot points in the book, an angry god causing a global flood, an angry god nuking two cities, father-daughter incest, slavery, rape both as a crime and as a path to marriage, genocides, murder of prisoners of war, taking of sex slaves including underage girls, etc., etc., etc.\n\nThere was nearly zero character development. The writing was awful. I literally didn't care about any of the characters or what happened to them. With all of the above plot points, the authors still managed to make the book just plain boring.\n\nAnd, since it was supposed to be a work of non-fiction, I could not just willingly suspend disbelief. This was a book by which people lived their lives. \n\nNo. I do not read the Bible as fantasy because A) people believe it and B) it's not written well enough to be entertaining.\n\nInstead, I read the book as if the words have meanings. I read it at face value. I do not expect there to be a consistent or good message. I am not looking for one. I read as much of it as I've read to know what's actually in this book that people live by. I have not read the book in its entirety.\n\n> The Bible is guiding you to spiritual salvation against the concept of hell being the default position for us.\n\nIf God created sentient beings capable of suffering and created the default position for us to be hell, then God is horrifically evil.\n\nWhy would God set things up that way?\n\n> The New Testament came about when the 'fact' that your salvation is required is well established.\n\nWhat does that mean? This was not a concept in Judaism. Among whom was this concept already well established?\n\n> What you're doing here is reading Jesus' message as \"If you don't do as I say, I'll push you off a cliff\", when the message is \"You're about to fall off a cliff, take my hand\".\n\nIf Yahweh/God/Jesus is truly all-knowing and all-powerful, these two statements are identical.\n\nWhy am I about to fall off a cliff? Because God set it up that way. \n\nI read it as this:\n\n**Jesus**: *Love and follow me so I can save you!*\n\n**Non-believer**: *Save me from what?*\n\n**Jesus**: *From what I'm going to do to you if you don't love and follow me!*\n\n> You answer your own question with why isn't it written better. Many authors over many periods of history.\n\nThen is it the word of those authors? Or, is it the word of God?\n\n> The trick I think, is not to resort to cherry picking.\n\nWith no consistent and coherent message, there is no choice but to cherry pick. Without cherry picking, the Bible says *everything* it says.\n\nWithout cherry picking, the Bible contains:\n\n* [1543 instances of injustice](http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/inj/long.html)\n\n* [1310 instances of cruelty](http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/cruelty/long.html)\n\n* [705 instances of intolerance](http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/cruelty/long.html)\n\n* [419 instances of horrific family values](http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/cruelty/long.html)\n\n* [392 instances of misogyny](http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/women/long.html)\n\n* [But only 344 objectively good verses](http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/good/long.html)\n\nAre you sure that with these numbers you don't want to cherry pick?\n\n> It's definitely something that religious nut jobs make a spectacular mess of: assuming that the Bible is a literal word-for-word perfect copy of the words of God. When in reality, there are only a few direct quotes from God (ten commandments and Jesus being prime examples). But it's also worth stressing that very little of the Bible is made up of instructions (as I'm sure you're well aware).\n\nHmm... The stories in the Bible are there. Whether they are phrased as instructions or not, we still have cases of horrific cruelty directly from God, directly ordered by God, and directly ordered by Moses.\n\nIt's hard to argue, for example, that God has a problem with genocide when God explicitly ordered 7 of them.\n\nIt's hard to argue that God has a problem with father-daughter incest when the people who commit it were just saved from the destruction of two evil cities for being the good people in the city. It's even harder to argue that God has a problem with this incest when Ruth is a descendant of that incest and becomes the great grandmother of King David, meaning that the line of the kings of Israel resulted from the incest of Lot with his daughters, specifically the elder daughter if memory serves.\n\nIt's hard to argue that God or Jesus have any issue with slavery when Colossians 4:1 says that masters should treat their slaves well because, in no uncertain terms, *all Christians are slaves to God/Jesus*.\n\n> And whilst this is rapidly moving into theological debate rather than whether The Bible is a candidate for \"best book of all time\".\n\nYou're right. I apologize for that. In discussing whether the book is the best book of all time, I have a very hard time ignoring what the book actually says. It's seriously gruesome.\n\n> You're quite right on the character of God, it's spelled out in the Ten Commandments: \"I the Lord your God am a jealous God\".\n\nJealousy is solidly based in insecurity. Why would God be insecure?\n\nDo you ever wonder of whom God is jealous?\n\n\"Thou shalt have no other gods before me.\"\n\nThis does not say that there are no other gods. Not that it really matters. But, the Abrahamic religion is monolatry rather than monotheism, or possibly henotheism. I'm not that clear on the subtle differences between those.\n\nI don't know if this matters much. I don't view monotheism as inherently better than polytheism. But, classical theism seems to work by \"proofs\" of God that can only make whatever sense they do if there is just one god. Of course, I don't know if you're a classical theist.\n\n> But also, I'm not entirely sure the relevancy. God is not a politician looking for the popular vote, God is (allegedly) the creator of our souls and the Universe in which we live, 'dem the rules', so to speak.\n\nThis is simply a might makes right argument. What if God were evil? If you believed that the God were actually the evil character in the Bible, would you still worship him?\n\n> But hold that up to what Christianity is actually asking you to do: don't be shit to each other, don't fall into the trappings of worldly possessions (probably because you land up being shit to others), and don't conjure up anything else to worship - not really all that bad IMHO.\n\nIf I believed that Christianity truly had those as it's only ideals, I might be OK with it. But, if that were true, if that were really the consistent and clear message of the scripture, how would you explain the following: crusades, inquisitions, the doctrine of manifest destiny and associated genocides of indigenous peoples, the Biblical justification of the transatlantic slave trade, the doctrine of Deicide and resulting antisemitism, pogroms, clinic bombings, doctor shootings, etc.?\n\n> Jews today of course reject Jesus as the Messiah, otherwise they would be Christians.\n\nMy point was not that Jews do not accept Jesus as the messiah of the Tanakh/Hebrew Bible (not the same as the Christian Old Testament which was modified deliberately with respect to the messianic prophesies). It's that they reject him for very good reasons. Jesus failed the prophesies of the Hebrew Bible quite massively.\n\n> Christian teaching is that the temple was rebuilt as Jesus stated, in three days....\n\nThis is wildly inconsistent with the Hebrew Bible, which is most definitely talking about a physical rebuilding of the actual temple.\n\n> But again this is getting heavily into theological debate and as a pretty poor Christian I'm probably not the going to be the person who can definitively answer your questions.\n\nI was raised only weakly Jewish. But, I can assure you that the the time of the messiah is very specific in the Jewish religion. It's actually a big topic at Passover Seders in particular. Since Christians generally believe that the last supper of Christ was a Passover Seder, this should be important to you. The communion wafers in Catholic churches are actually based on the Afikomen at a Passover Seder.\n\n> But I stand by my assertion that The Bible should be considered one of the best books of all time, I guess even based on the level of debate it's created through such a long period - nothing else has come close to that level of influence.\n\nIf an only if greatness is measured by influence without regard to the quality of that influence or the actual bloodshed or the quality of the writing or the consistency of the message, I would agree.\n\n> I think the heavy down votes on my post really highlight more of an anti-theist sentiment rather than a genuine disagreement of my suggestion.\n\nI think many of us do not like to call something great if the effect of it has been great harm.\n\nI do agree that there is a bias against religion on this sub.\n\nI further appreciate your recognition of the distinction between atheism and antitheism. I happen to be both an atheist and an antitheist. But, the distinction is important. Thank you for that.\n\n> you are clearly vigorously anti-religion and I don't think anything I will say will change any of that view.\n\nI agree.\n\n> there may be an alternative way of reading the Bible that you have not previously considered.\n\nI have considered and rejected that idea.
