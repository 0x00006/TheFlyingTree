{"title": "Sleep paralysis and hallucinations", "name": "t3_pit23q", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/pit23q/sleep_paralysis_and_hallucinations/", "selftext": "How many of you have experienced hallucinations whilst waking or falling asleep (hypnagogic, hypnopompic), experienced sleep paralysis, or experienced the terrifying combination of the two?\n\nI'm prone to the hallucinations which are normally very benign and simple: every few months I will hallucinate \"ghosts\" in my room (simple human bodies) sitting on a chair, walking across the room, etc. These are usually peaceful occurrences because the ghosts don't pay attention to me, aren't aware of me, and I can move away and close my eyes and go to sleep.\n\nHowever, twice now I've had the combination of sleep paralysis and a hallucination. On both occasions, these are terrifying. Five years ago, I woke up on my back, in the dark, unable to move, and with a demon snarling down at me. The face is still vivid in my memory because it was truly haunting. I couldn't move, couldn't scream, couldn't shut my eyes or do anything for the entire experience. I was unable to sleep without a light on for some time after that.\n\nTonight, I woke up paralysed and there was a man stood above my bed. He repeatedly stabbed me whilst I laid there unable to move. I could feel the \"holes\" and drag of his knife through my body, so I was surprised when the experience ended and that I was completely OK because it felt so real - the paralysis suddenly broke which caused the hallucination to disappear the moment I looked away.\n\nI speak freely about these experiences in real life because I find it absolutely fascinating how fucked up the brain can be, however normally I freak out others who've never experienced anything like this. Figured I'd pop this up as a discussion here and invite you all to maybe share your hallucination and paralysis, or any other funky brain-sleep experiences here, for us all to marvel at how complex and weird the brain is.", "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/pit23q/sleep_paralysis_and_hallucinations/", "id": "pit23q", "author": "bethcano", "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "num_comments": 25, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630905898.0, "comments": [{"author": "solongfish99", "id": "hbrzuoz", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #183 | Classis Veritatus", "submission": "pit23q", "stickied": false, "body": "There was [another post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/pgf9p9/sleep_paralysis/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) about this rather recently, you might find some of those comments relevant.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630906585.0, "parent_id": "t3_pit23q", "replies": [{"author": "bethcano", "id": "hbs74d0", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #40", "submission": "pit23q", "stickied": false, "body": "Thank you for sharing this with me!

The recap of my comment then was that there are systems in the brain that prevent you from moving while you dream, and that sleep paralysis is when part of your brain wakes up while that system is still turned on. Hallucinations during this are because you actually are still asleep. \n\nAs I understand it, sleep itself is needed in vertebrates because of the blood-brain barrier. The brain is protected from anything that might be in the blood by a filter that allows only certain things through. As the brain works though, waste products build up and these are not allowed through either. During sleep, pores open in the barrier and the brain can flush and refresh and repair. Different levels of sleep represent different stages in this repair process. Dreaming appears to be what the brain does while the different parts are disconnected for service. \n\nI've heard hypotheses that dreams represent the brain strengthening various neural correlates as a sort of 'training' function. Memories appear to be stored in the structure of the neural connections in various parts of the brain. The more you use a 'memory', the stronger those connections become and thus the more likely that 'memory' is to be included in the current conscious processing. So it's not really that you had a dream where you were naked on the pitcher's mound at Yankee Stadium. It's that your brain was fiddling around with various memories, sensoria, and concepts, and your bored conscious mind tried to create a coherent narrative around them.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630943647.0, "parent_id": "t3_pit23q", "replies": []}, {"author": "SuperfluousApathy", "id": "hbw1qxm", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #492", "submission": "pit23q", "stickied": false, "body": "I've had both.\n\nFirst time I was a young teen.
