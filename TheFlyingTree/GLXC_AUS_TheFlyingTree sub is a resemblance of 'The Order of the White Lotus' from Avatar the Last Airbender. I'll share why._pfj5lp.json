As it gradually grew in numbers and influence, the order became ever more sophisticated. It transcended being a mere club and assumed responsibility for sharing knowledge around the world. Eventually, the order began to influence various Avatars and steer them toward working for the good for all mankind, as its members covertly became the Avatars' teachers and protectors.\"\n\n\"They derived their name from the\u00a0white lotus\u00a0tile used in Pai Sho, which is also a key element in their strategy.
