I think people kind of judge 4 with the knowledge of 3 in the backs of their heads.\n\nIf you think about it, the setup is pretty solid, and flows nicely from the plot of 2. Rumpelstiltskin\u2019s motivation as a villain makes a lot of sense. There\u2019s a lot of theming in the first two movies about responding to societal expectations vs staying true to yourself that carries over into 4. Shriek starts off 1 embracing the expectations society has for him, but is unable to truly be himself and make connections. The end of that movie sees him comfortably himself with people who care about him. In 2 he struggles with trying to change himself to be accepted by society, and by the end, society accepts him, and changes a bit. At the beginning of 4, he feels that the acceptance he\u2019s gained and everything he\u2019s fought to achieve has come at the cost of parts of who he is. It\u2019s a reflection of the beginning of 1. He feels the weight of a society that expects him to act a certain way (exemplified by the \u201cdo the roar\u201d scene) and he feels like everything he worked for wasn\u2019t worth the effort. He feels alone, and like he has to put on a front, the same as in the first movie. The only difference is that he no longer has a space for himself to unwind after it all. That\u2019s the mindset he\u2019s in at the beginning of the movie. We catch him at the lowest he\u2019s felt for a long time. This is why Shrek makes the deal with Rumpel.\n\nOther than that, the dynamic of a Shrek who has become more positive playing off of the other characters who have become warped by this darker timeline is really well done. The relationship between Donkey and Shrek is especially interesting consider, they\u2019re pretty much the opposite of how they were in the first movie.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628904496.0, "parent_id": "t3_p3ao59", "replies": [{"author": "Haikouden", "id": "h8wmnln", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #65 | Classis Veritatus", "submission": "p3ao59", "stickied": false, "body": "Would agree that people judge 4 too harshly.\n\nIf you treat the franchise as 1 -> 2 -> 4 then it flows a lot better in terms of the characters (especially Shrek), but 4 also comes out a lot better because it isn't soured by 3.
