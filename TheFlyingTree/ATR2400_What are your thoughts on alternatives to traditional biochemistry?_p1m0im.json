We all know that life on earth is carbon based and that we need water to survive. Pretty simple, right? But what if that isn\u2019t the only way for life to exist. There are alternatives to the traditional biochemistry we know.\n\nThe most popular is of course using silicon in place of carbon. There are some problems of course. Silicon isn\u2019t quite as good as good as carbon but still it can\u2019t be ruled out as a basis for at least microbial life. Life tends to find a way and who\u2019s to say that if carbon isn\u2019t an option that the next best thing will have to do?\n\nThere are also alternative solvents. Water is our main solvent. It\u2019s what we drink to you know\u2026 not die. The big two alternatives to water I\u2019ve seen are ammonia and methane. Methane is more well known thanks to Titan popularizing the idea of methane drinking microbes. Ammonia isn\u2019t quite as popular but I find it really really cool. Ammonia is a very common molecule just like H2O and is quite similar to water fundamentally. It even has a similar structure. Ammonia\u2019s capabilities as a solvent give water a run for its money as well. It has its problems of course but once again life finds a way and in  the absence of water ammonia might just be good enough. \n\nThe biggest problem with ammonia and methane are that they don\u2019t like to be liquid at Earth temperature and pressures. For an ammonia or methane hydrosphere to exist the planet would either need to be really cold or have high pressure. This could have an interesting effect on possible life. \n\n\nMy opinion would have to be the fairly boring one that alternatives to life as we know it are very cool. I have a soft spot for ammonia based life and play as an ammonia based species in a geopolitical space roleplay. Whether or not ammonia and silicon could support intelligent life is a whole other question but I could definitely see microscopic lifeforms making it work.", "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.64, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/p1m0im/what_are_your_thoughts_on_alternatives_to/", "id": "p1m0im", "author": "ATR2400", "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "num_comments": 18, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628588940.0, "comments": [{"author": "FnchWzrd314", "id": "h8ebsc0", "score": 4, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #53 | Ordo Cognitus", "submission": "p1m0im", "stickied": false, "body": "I remember hearing about a theoretical plastic based biosphere.

Carbon generally has stronger bonds than silicon, but you can still make long chains with it. \n\nI think that nitrogen could also serve as a potential backbone for life. While it isn't as similar to carbon as silicon is, it can still make bonds and form long chains. This form of life would look completely different from anything we have ever seen before.\n\nAlso, I believe I read something a few years back about a bacteria that doesn't survive off of water.
