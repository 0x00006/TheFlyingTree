Then comes the crash of low blood sugar. I'm back on the upswing now after that. So, that's good. But, I'll probably go too high.\n\nCome take a [virtual ride on Coney Island's Cyclone roller coaster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2-RXqU4Lg8) with me. Or just tell me what's keeping you up this nearly full moon evening.\n\n---\n\nJust as an aside, of course much wilder rollercoasters than the Cyclone exist today. What makes the Cyclone truly scary as fuck is that it's a landmarked wooden structure built in 1927. \n\nThe sounds and feel of the damn thing as you try not to think about dry rot or a century of salt spray or if any of the structure is actually still original really add to the ~~amazing~~ terrifying experience.

I'm waiting impatiently for the 780G that has been out in Europe for quite a while now. It was supposed to be available April 2020 here but everything got delayed with COVID. FDA was busy elsewhere. Medtronic was probably busy throwing all their money at ramping up production of their ventilators. So, I can't fault anyone. I just want the next version of my pump already. The 770 -> 780 upgrade is just a software download. I already have the physical pump and am just waiting for an enormous software upgrade.\n\nOn the BG meters, my first was an Accucheck that checked the color change on a chemical test strip that had to be wiped after N seconds. That's probably similar to your first. About a year later, Exactech came out as the first one that measured the current created by the chemical reaction (as all meters do now).
