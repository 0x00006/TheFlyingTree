{"title": "A Fun Little Theory I Had...", "name": "t3_pjkonk", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/pjkonk/a_fun_little_theory_i_had/", "selftext": "*I should clarify that I don\u2019t really take any of this stuff seriously- it\u2019s no more real to me than a comic book or any other conspiracy theory, but I understand some people may take this *VERY* seriously so like... don\u2019t get offended. It\u2019s not my intention to do so, and I\u2019m not trying to make any statements about anyone\u2019s religion- just goofing around with some ideas.*\n\nThink for a minute about what most Christian depictions if God is like; there\u2019s the Old Testament which shows god as terrifying, wrathful, vengeful, and almost hating humans. Depicted as a tyrant I\u2019d say, and with all the angels (and saints if you\u2019re catholic) being these awful assholes of abstract rules and laws... then think about how they described these guys visually, almost Cthulhu-esque. Mortals were alleged to flee in terror, go insane, or worse when seeing their true forms.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at Satan; depicted as Lucifer Morningstar, and Angel fallen from Heaven and either sent to rule he\u2019ll as penance or willingly claiming that realm as his own (depending on the story). Chaotic, free, full of debauchery, and hedonistic by nature- it\u2019s reminiscent of many deities in other religions, not evil ones though... usually tricksters or divine beings tied to nature and primality. \n\nSo on the one hand we have \u201cGod\u201d who\u2019s tyrannical, full of rules, wrathful, and then is associated with the Heavens; then you have \u201cSatan\u201d who\u2019s chaotic, hedonistic, and wild, and is associated with the depths of Hell... it\u2019s not hard then to see parallels they have to another concept...\n\nLet\u2019s imagine Satan is a manifestation of nature; the primal, unpredictable, and wild aspects of the world. An embodiment of the Earth even, since his realm is often depicted being in the depths beneath us. Then God would be an Outsider, something from beyond. You could think of God as alien if that helped, or a rival deity- but God is not from here. God is essentially an invader.\n\nSo imagine it now; think about the story of God and Satan from that perspective instead... You are a tyrant, you invade and take over a world of people, and to make sure nobody questions you you\u2019re going to disenfranchise your enemy and make them seem as if they were always beneath your control, that they were a traitor, and that they\u2019re pure evil... that they were never a god to begin with. So now think about the New Testament, how the look of God has changed over time and how there\u2019s essentially been a \u201crebranding\u201d to something more palatable to humans over time. \n\nThat\u2019s the theory; God is some foreign invader who overthrew Satan, the original \u201cGaia\u201d in a sense, and sold a conspiracy to cover it up. It\u2019s a fun thought experiment, and I don\u2019t believe in any of that religious stuff- but it\u2019s still pretty cool huh?", "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/pjkonk/a_fun_little_theory_i_had/", "id": "pjkonk", "author": "FlynnXa", "link_flair_text": "Idea", "num_comments": 9, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1631011860.0, "comments": [{"author": "DoglessDyslexic", "id": "hbx2lxq", "score": 4, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #170", "submission": "pjkonk", "stickied": false, "body": "Worth noting that Yahweh in Christianity is derivative of Elohim/El from the Semitic polytheistic pantheon which in turn derivative of the Babylonian and Canaanite polytheistic pantheons.

Essentially having removed a source of conflict from a polytheistic pantheon, the Semitic theologians of the time needed an opposition figure and a solution for the problem of evil, since otherwise there would be no explanation for why an unopposed Yahweh could not make the world a paradise.\n\nAlso worth noting that angels and demons used to be more along the lines of greater and lesser servants of the gods, but over time the demons were increasingly associated with evil, and in Milton's \"Paradise Lost\" (among other influences) cemented in the minds of the masses the notion of them and Satan being exiled to hell.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1631013350.0, "parent_id": "t3_pjkonk", "replies": []}, {"author": "Flesh_Bag", "id": "hbx0wj0", "score": 3, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #95", "submission": "pjkonk", "stickied": false, "body": "Hmm, im listening.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1631012093.0, "parent_id": "t3_pjkonk", "replies": []}, {"author": "Buarg", "id": "hbx6sh7", "score": 3, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Initiate", "submission": "pjkonk", "stickied": false, "body": "Well, from a comparative mythology point of view that's pretty much what happened.
