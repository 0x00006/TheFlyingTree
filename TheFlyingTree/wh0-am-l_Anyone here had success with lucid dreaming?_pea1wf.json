One of the first key steps for me was doing an accounting of the previous night's dreams before getting out of bed in the morning. This can be a dream journal, or as I did it, just reviewing them in your mind before fully waking up. \n\nThe next thing I felt was helpful was trying to keep awareness as I began to fall asleep. This one takes a lot of getting used to and learning meditation techniques will definitely help. But I basically slowly let my sleep paralysis kick in on purpose. Because I am in control of it, it is not scary and it will often land me in a lucid dreaming state.\n\nThe other aspect I used was indeed reality checks and mnemonics to prime me to be able to recognize a dreaming state. It gets easier with time, and you can choose to stop doing it if you are not interested in having lucid dreams for a period.\n\nI did experiment with Wake Induced Lucid Dreaming, but did not find it particularly helpful compared to the hassle. Another thing I noticed was that higher doses of melatonin gave me more vivid dreams and a slightly higher likelihood of having a lucid period.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630328163.0, "parent_id": "t3_pea1wf", "replies": [{"author": "dotieeeee", "id": "haxavwa", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #286", "submission": "pea1wf", "stickied": false, "body": "Amen to this: dream journals work, if not, just \"review\" your dreams lol.

I remember reading an article when I was a kid about it, it suggested trying to fly when you get stuck in a sitution in your dream you don't want to be in. When you're being chased, for instance.\n\nIt's the reason why I rarely have bad dreams/nightmares. I once had a dream about someone chasing me with a knife or a sword (idk it was something pointy) so what I did was I faced that person and \"willed\" a sword to appear in my hand and we duelled.\n\nAnother timen I was stuck in a bad place I don't remember anymore, but I willed a wand to appear in my pocket and whipped it out and cast some sort of spell. \n\nThis I dreamed just two nights ago: I met a teenage girl who was in a cult and she was trying to get out of it (Save Me, a Korean drama, anyone) so I helped her escape. Somehow they found out about our plans and cultists were chasing us in the middle of this dark market. At that point I already knew I was dreaming and it sounds creepy but I'm telling you, I was having so much fun, I felt the adrenaline rush even in the dream and I LOVED it. So anywayn we were being chased and I knew they were already about to close in on us so what I did was \"willed\" a phone in my pocket and called my boyfriend in the dream (I have no boyfriend irl lol and it's funny because that boyfriend happened to be a famous local celebrity in my country that I didn't even have a crush on) to pick us up at this corner of the market. The boyfriend arrived and got us out of there safely. Next thing I knew I was in a seminar with the teenage girl where she was describing her experiences in the cult and I felt really proud of both of us for getting her out there. This is a true dream, I swear.\n\nNow have been other dreams that I found really disturbing, and I would be aware, but sometimes I like to just go with the flow and see what happens, because I know if I get stuck I have a method to get out of it.\n\nSo yeah, try flying maybe?", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630327355.0, "parent_id": "t3_pea1wf", "replies": []}, {"author": "shig23", "id": "havxs3o", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Druid #5", "submission": "pea1wf", "stickied": false, "body": "I tried LaBerge\u2019s MILD technique, long ago, and had a little success but not much.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630294221.0, "parent_id": "t3_pea1wf", "replies": []}, {"author": "Kelyaan", "id": "haw09zr", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #271 | Consortii Concordus", "submission": "pea1wf", "stickied": false, "body": "Tried many external methods and it never worked, I have had it happen a few times naturally but with all \"lucid dreaming\" the moment you realise it you begin to wake up.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630295593.0, "parent_id": "t3_pea1wf", "replies": []}, {"author": "roundearthervaxxer", "id": "haw3a2m", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #273", "submission": "pea1wf", "stickied": false, "body": "Yes, when I was younger.
