And maybe that's true? Maybe they did. But the 90s were an utterly different time in many countries, and I'm not at all convinced that you'll find a particularly american trend of parenting. And yet, it's not at all obvious to me that we see these havens of peaceful discourse altering according to this. \n\nWe do see places where young people have better mental health, northern european countries for example, and in those places, where parenting encourages independence in such a way as to be [used as a model](http://web.archive.org/web/20190302024623/https://time.com/5541144/parenting-advice-scandinavians/) for those who advocate it in the US, many of the arguments about the acceptability of speech that Haidt and co. claim are symptoms of coddling like advocating for \"safe spaces\" [also exist](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14675986.2019.1540102).\n\n> In an interview with the student, he and his friends described that they experienced the classroom conversation as so polarised that they often chose not to express their views, since they felt misunderstood and unduly criticised. They placed themselves to the political right, expressing critical views of immigration and Islam. They were occasionally called racists and Nazis by other students. They found this wrong and offensive, as they themselves thought they were only \u2018telling how it is\u2019. Their view was that only \u2018politically correct\u2019 utterances were allowed in the classroom and that their opinions were perceived as politically incorrect. Interestingly, other students in the same class had a completely different view of what was said and what was possible to say in the classroom. They perceived that this group of students expressed xenophobic views, generalised and distorted images of Islam, that Islam often became synonymous with Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and that these perceptions were becoming increasingly normalised in society as well as in classroom conversations. When articulating this, they were accused of renouncing \u2018political correctness\u2019, denying unambiguous facts about immigration and Islam.\n\n> In this example, particular groups of students perceived the situation in the classroom quite differently. While some perceived the classroom as politically correct, in the sense that only some opinions are allowed in the RE lessons, other students had the experience that both racism and hatred towards Islam was included in the classroom discourse. This tension between the two groups of students reflects to a great extent the polarised climate in the Swedish public debate on freedom of speech, immigration, Islam and political correctness; by using the term \u2018political correctness\u2019, the student positioned himself within this wider political discourse. What is of interest here is why the students had these different perceptions of what was being said in the classroom. In conversations with the students, it became clear that it was not only students with a migration background who felt that the other group of students articulated xenophobic ideas. Also, pupils with Swedish majority backgrounds stated that the immigration criticism that had been raised in the classroom had racist connotations.\n\nIf these discussions about freedom of speech were primarily due to subconscious influences of parenting in the US, causing people to suppress disagreement, in other words, if the pathologisation of these practices is to be seen as plausible, you'd need to explain how some of the most mentally healthy young adults and teenagers in the world have been having these conversations too.\n\nSo I could be wrong, but that thesis feels a little bit like creating an explanation of differences of coronavirus infections that only works within your city, because that's the only place you bothered to get data from.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628636214.0, "parent_id": "t1_h8gn3m9", "replies": [{"author": "LoreleiOpine", "id": "h8h23am", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #52", "submission": "p1i6nm", "stickied": false, "body": "We disagree.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628639342.0, "parent_id": "t1_h8gvjbi", "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"author": "Natural-Sun-8613", "id": "h8dl3nl", "score": 6, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "", "submission": "p1i6nm", "stickied": false, "body": "Humans that are allowed to travel wherever they want within a confined space.

We\u2019re in a beautiful area with a lake, rocky cliffs, a forest, and of course a large grassland. I haven\u2019t ran around like this in 20 years! \n\nThe days are spent tinkering, philosophizing, reflecting, and bonding with my new free range friends. A lot of our food is found and prepped ourselves, but a few times a day Rebecca calls us in with a yodel in case we need more snacks. \n\nThe peace and serenity are amazing. My time is my own. My community cares and wants to build. I just don\u2019t have the same problems as I did before\u2026I hope you make it here soon.\n\nRegards,\n\nGhostley92\u201d", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628697483.0, "parent_id": "t3_p1i6nm", "replies": [{"author": "H0bg0blin0verl0rd", "id": "h8jwotu", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "", "submission": "p1i6nm", "stickied": false, "body": "I can honestly say I don't know what to make of this...but I do not dislike it.", "is_submitter": true, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628700339.0, "parent_id": "t1_h8jpxen", "replies": [{"author": "Ghostley92", "id": "h8k00nd", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #166", "submission": "p1i6nm", "stickied": false, "body": "When can we expect you?", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628701745.0, "parent_id": "t1_h8jwotu", "replies": []}]}]}, {"author": "idiotsonfire", "id": "h8ebnaa", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "", "submission": "p1i6nm", "stickied": false, "body": "What, like chickens?", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628594175.0, "parent_id": "t3_p1i6nm", "replies": []}, {"author": "QuatroDoesGood", "id": "h8embvr", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #55", "submission": "p1i6nm", "stickied": false, "body": "Like living in a simulation", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1628600787.0, "parent_id": "t3_p1i6nm", "replies": []}, {"author": "THF-Killingpro", "id": "h8evu8l", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "", "submission": "p1i6nm", "stickied": false, "body": "Sounds like something aliens would buy in their shops as food or as pets.
