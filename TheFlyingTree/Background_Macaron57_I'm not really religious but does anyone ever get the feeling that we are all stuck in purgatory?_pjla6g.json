Same here. You try to see a reason in what is happening to you. Not knowing your background or your life, I can't say for sure where you are coming from. But it is probably safe to say that it is a combination of living in a place that does not offer much social security; being (mostly) on your own, with no-one to share your problems; and seeing mostly the negatives sides of your live, while at the same time ignoring that other people struggle with the same shit.
