Kinda weird but I got my first cheque book today, which I'm pretty pleased with. I always wanted to get one, not really for any practical reason (I have no need for it right now) but I just liked the idea. It always seemed like part of being an adult to me. Back when I opened my account at the bank though there was never any mention of getting a cheque book and I kind of assumed that meant I couldn't get one with the type of account I was opening so I never mentioned it for fear of having to go through everything all over again. By now I'd just kind of accepted it that I couldn't have one with my account. Then the other day I discovered that you can request a cheque book on the bank's website. It was literally that simple. I feel kind of silly for never looking before now. But nevertheless I've got it now! And now I can feel a bit more like a proper adult haha.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1626720428.0, "parent_id": "t3_onit8y", "replies": [{"author": "Yoruichi-san1", "id": "h5s8up5", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "", "submission": "onit8y", "stickied": false, "body": "Thank you for your reply and I feel happy for you to feel like an adult.", "is_submitter": true, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1626720808.0, "parent_id": "t1_h5s7yk3", "replies": [{"author": "Riadys", "id": "h5s91tn", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #151 | Consortii Concordus", "submission": "onit8y", "stickied": false, "body": "Cheers haha.
