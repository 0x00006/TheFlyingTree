This means generally that the subject doesn't do things.  Things are done 'by the subject'.  So:\n\n1.) Several small principalities were formed into a confederation of 39 states under Napoleon's administration.\n\n2.) A customs union, or *zollverein*, was formed under the initiative of Prussia and joined by most German states. (Foreign words are typically italicized in writing.)\n\n3.) National unification became economically more feasible by the creation of a network of railways that increased<the> mobility <of goods>.  (Not sure I correctly put this one in the passive voice to be honest, but structuring the sentence this way emphasizes the national unification being the result of the rail network.  You also wouldn't need to include that it's goods that have increased mobility, but if that's the point you're trying to drive home, being specific can't hurt.)\n\n4.) Wider nationalist sentiments were strengthened by a wave of economic nationalism.  (This one I structured this way because 'wider nationalist sentiments' is a bigger notion than the specific 'wave of economic nationalism' so to me, it seems like the economic nationalism is just a smaller part attributing to the wider nationalism)", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1626908747.0, "parent_id": "t3_ooomw9", "replies": []}, {"author": "TheobromaKakao", "id": "h605v6s", "score": -3, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "", "submission": "ooomw9", "stickied": false, "body": "Shit went down and here we are.\n\nSummed up all of history for you.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1626876343.0, "parent_id": "t3_ooomw9", "replies": [{"author": "GrisSumnemo", "id": "h6080no", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #15", "submission": "ooomw9", "stickied": false, "body": "Useful.
