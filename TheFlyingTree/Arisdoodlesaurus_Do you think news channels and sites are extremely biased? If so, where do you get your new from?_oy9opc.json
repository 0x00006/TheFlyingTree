But with national news, it tends to be politically biased as to what they will cover.

I do think CNN, MSNBC and Fox News have gotten away from being news channels because of this. Nearly everything on those channels is actually anchors and fake anchors who have their own shows. But again, this is why I read national papers like NYT, WSJ and WaPo, as well as news feeds and the web sites for CNN and MSNBC.

Now the alarm bells are really going off and I'm think this pervert is buying this kid an M rated game and going to lure him back to his house. Management shows up. We call the cops. They run out of the store.

The role of journalism is to contextualize factual events, explaining them within history, past actions, past statements, past experiences as a journalist. That kind of investigative and meaning-providing work is extremely human and subjective, and that's okay as long as the perspective of the journalist is clear.\n\nTo invert this: You cannot have \"unbiased\" news unless they report raw facts without any contextualization, which would not be very valuable. Even then, deciding which events \"qualify\" as news is a subjective choice.\n\nProviding \"balance\" is a subjective assessment. Which sources are 'trusted'? Do you report statements from the CDC? A police department? A homeless encampment? The white house? When a politician makes a statement, do you report it as is? Do you fact-check what they say? Do you find a counter-statement from a politician on \"the other side\"? Even for things where the \"other side\" is speaking in bad faith, like the existence of climate change, or the legitimacy of an election, or the importance of vaccines and masks? When you present \"the other side\", how do you decide what that is? If you're in the U.S. and you're presenting the liberal and conservative talking points as \"the two sides\", that's an _incredibly_ narrow view of politics compared with European or worldwide political parties.\n\nI get some daily news headlines from [Democracy Now](https://www.democracynow.org/), who I trust to cover activism and misconduct of authority, and not to be corporate representatives.
