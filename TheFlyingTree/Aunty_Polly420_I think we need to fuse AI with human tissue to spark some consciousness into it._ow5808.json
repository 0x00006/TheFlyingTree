My thought process is, well the atoms which make us (humans) up didn't suddenly appear when we were born, that's billions of years of universal evolution from the big bang up till now, so in that time our atoms have been through a lot. Perhaps all those 'experiences', or rather phases of rearranging they've gone through is stored somewhere. I don't mean this in some sort of profound way, just objectively there could be something in our atomic makeup that has been bookeeping what our atoms (or even more fundamental level of reality) have been up to this whole time. This has led to some monkeys not too long ago, evolving into smarter monkeys who \"think\" about stuff. \n\nThere must be something unique about all these elements forming cells, and then complex systems that sparks this ability to realise a bunch of atoms is made of atoms. We'll call this place where this info is stored the cloud. Now computers so far are made up of basic elements, adopt a few quantum mechanical properties and are able to process/transmit information; at the same time it's very complicated but still not as complicated as the human consciousness.\n\n You could say that the AI we have today don't have premium access to the cloud like we do, the only access it has is the access we give it, so it's like forcing basic elements like silicone and other materials to have some level of perception of reality. However it is not enough to be on the same scale as humans. Even though the atoms that make up the elements in electronics have been through a lot too they didn't form the same way as we did through a roll of the dice i guess. \n\nSo perhaps, we need to either map out the brain accurately and feed it into AI (which I think is being attempted already but we don't quite know all the ins and outs of our own minds) or perhaps go a bit further and have the atoms in an AI interact more meaningfully with organic tissue - almost fusing AI with humans, but in such a way that the information in our atoms gets shared with the information in theirs. Actually typing this out sounds really stupid lol, but if this cloud system has a little bit of truth to it then having our atoms share our 'secrets' of our experiences since the start, it might spark something in an AI to be all like uhuh i get it so I'm a thing made of things and I can now independently 'think' by seeing how all your things developed. \n\n\nFeel free to share any ideas you might have or to tell me why this is idea is bs!", "score": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "permalink": "/r/TheFlyingTree/comments/ow5808/i_think_we_need_to_fuse_ai_with_human_tissue_to/", "id": "ow5808", "author": "Aunty_Polly420", "link_flair_text": "Idea", "num_comments": 21, "over_18": false, "spoiler": false, "pinned": false, "locked": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1627869554.0, "comments": [{"author": "BuccaneerRex", "id": "h7fckdu", "score": 4, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Seeker #96", "submission": "ow5808", "stickied": false, "body": "It's a sweet idea, but not supported by actual science. \n\nFundamental particles are indistinguishable. There is no way even in principle to tell one electron from another. \n\nOnce you get into the depths of things like quantum field theory, you find that it is highly likely that particles aren't the fundamental components of existence either, and it is the fields themselves that are fundamental.\n\nOr if you dig even deeper you find things like causal hypergraphs which are a way of going even deeper into the fundamental nature of physics. In these formulations, the 'real' things are just the nodes, which are dimensionless, timeless, spaceless points, and the entangled connections between them. They follow basic rules of updating, and from these simple constructs you can extrapolate all the rules of physics. Or at least spacetime, particles, energy, conservation laws, and relativity so far. They're working on other things like quantum gravity.\n\nThe point of all of this is that it is not the particles that have memory. Particles have no memory. We are patterns, not objects. We are collectives, insanely complicated layers of mass and energy and interaction and propagation of potential through at least 4 dimensions.\n\nHuman consciousness isn't magic or special. It's analog and messy and far too big and hot for quantum effects to matter on any real scale. \n\nMinds are grown, not built. I strongly suspect that no matter how good our computers get, we'll never be able to write all the code ahead of time and flip the switch and have a 0-day fully functional AI. \n\nWe will be able to get everything ready, and set the stage, and when we flip the switch it will start growing and training. And after a while we'll have a functional AI, based on what we've trained it to do. \n\nI suspect that Artificial General intelligence is a lot farther away than we'd like, and that it's going to require the assistance of artificial specific intelligences to create.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1627910412.0, "parent_id": "t3_ow5808", "replies": [{"author": "Aunty_Polly420", "id": "h7fgx4w", "score": 1, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #133", "submission": "ow5808", "stickied": false, "body": "thank you for taking the time to write out this response!

The extremely short version is that the hypergraphs are an extension of concepts from cellular automata onto dimensionless nodes in graph space, where the only elements are nodes and edges, with basic rules for 'updating' connections at any given instant. As you add more and more nodes and connections and follow the rules, you get more and more elaborate 'structures' in the pure math that evolve over updates in ways that behave like the elements of physical systems do. So far they've identified things like conservation of momentum and energy, general relativity, and a few other basic physics in these structures behaviors)\n\nThe hot and messy part refers to the fact that on the scales of neurons, quantum effects beyond the gross are negligible. (By gross effects I mean the kinds of classical electrochemical stuff that doesn't need quantum mechanics to describe. Orbitals and such are enough to explain the chemistry involved without having to delve to a deeper layer to explain things.\n\nMy personal hypothesis is that consciousness is an act of self-modeling. Our big vertebrate brains are pattern matching engines.  If you go back in evolutionary history to the origins of the animalia kingdom, brains are the bits of the nervous system where signals are processed. But what does it mean for a 'signal' to be 'processed'? Data enters the system as physical changes to whatever's doing the senses, which triggers a nerve to fire (firing is a chemical change that allows a wave of electrical potential to move down the nerve as a change in sodium and potassium ion concentrations. This change causes a cascade of more firings that trigger other chemical changes that in turn cause the organism to react in whatever way is appropriate.\n\nThere's a point of view in which your mind (or any collection of neurons doing this kind of processing) is in a 'black box'. it gets inputs, it processes them, and turns them into outputs. When you're a baby, all the inputs are new and your system doesn't know what to do with most of them. Your brain sends whatever outputs it can, and sees how the inputs change. To do this, it creates models. It has models of physics (what goes up must come down, etc.) models of people (poke a person they get angry, and more specific models of people (poke Joe-bob he gets punchy) etc. \n\nAs you grow over time, you are refining your technique of interpreting (sensory) inputs and generating outputs (signals to your body to do something). Your black box is generating a better and better model of the universe outside its prison over time. \n\nFrom the brain's point of view, you could be in the matrix, or a 'Brain in a Jar' or haunted by an evil demon (Descartes was writing before sci-fi cliches). Cogito, ergo sum. I think, therefore I am.\n\nBut what Descartes got wrong is that you are NOT separate from your model. You are getting inputs and generating outputs that do not come from or go to the outside. 'You', the you that you think does your thinking, is a part of your model of reality. It is the model your has of yourself and your behavior. \n\nConsciousness is basically the executive summary of this model. Your brain has a lot of data that it never sends up the chain to the top floor. Consciousness is what your brain thinks you need to know right now in order to generate the basic plan for navigating reality.", "is_submitter": false, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1627920995.0, "parent_id": "t1_h7fgx4w", "replies": []}, {"author": "SavnetSinn", "id": "h7g2gvy", "score": 2, "subreddit": "TheFlyingTree", "author_flair": "Acolyte #73 | Ordo Cognitus", "submission": "ow5808", "stickied": false, "body": "Ben Goertzel's OpenCog project is developing a software cognitive model on a hypergraph-based architecture.
