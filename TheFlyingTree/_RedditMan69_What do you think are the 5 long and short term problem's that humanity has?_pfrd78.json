Overpopulation.  To solve this I'd say we need population management techniques.  Many first world countries have negative population growth already, which is roughly good, but it can have some serious implications to labor availability if not well managed.  Getting experts on population management to plot and help maintain a course of reduced population with multinational agreement is almost certainly not feasible.  But I think it's what we need.  Note that the alternative method of reducing population aka diebacks, are typically really really unpleasant.  And in the future, likely worse than they were in the past.  Nobody during the Irish potato famine had access to nukes, but now if one country starts starving to death there's a real possibility that they'll try to take what their neighbors have and that very well may go nuclear.  Or worse, biological for those countries that have been carrying out bioweapons research on the sly (which is likely most of them).  Far better to have a few hundred years of managed population gradually reducing our population to more manageable levels than having a few years of famine followed by a couple days of nuclear war wiping out 95% of humanity.  This is both a short term and long term issue.\n\n2.  Habitat destruction.  Humans are a wrecking ball environmentally.  Part of this stems from our overpopulation, but honestly a lot of it is economical.  To fix it, you again need an international agreement and dedicated professionals managing human expansion and habitat use, and they have to have both the willingness to act and the power to do so.  So environmental warriors that can override sovereign powers.  Again, this doesn't seem likely to happen.  This is also both a near and short term issue.\n\n3.  Carbon.  Namely our propensity to put a lot of it in the air.  It needs to stop, and right damn soon.  I'll classify it as a short term problem, but that's because if we don't fix it, there won't be a long term.  Both of the first two issues will be greatly exacerbated by rising global temperatures.\n\n4. Nukes.  In and of themselves I don't particular object to them, they've ushered in an age of unprecedented peace (Yes, really! Look at history and the frequency of wars between nations in the 200 years before nuclear weapons).  But the value in nuclear weapons is in not using them.  Should we get to a point where it looks like they actually will get used, then we're all kinda fucked.  Like, for instance, if overpopulation, coupled with habitat destruction and global warming rendered large amounts of arable land unusable causing a bunch of nations to go to war with each other.  Fallout is bad enough, but coupled with their tendency to destroy a lot of electrical infrastructure which is one of the legs our technological civilization stands on, and you're looking at some really bad things happening.  There is no solution to this, because one country getting rid of nukes just means any other country that doesn't has an advantage over them.  And if you could magically get rid of all of them, that means that there's nothing to stop countries from going at each other the way they used to, only with more deadly conventional arms.  On the plus side, nuclear winter might offset global warming, but we'd likely be too dead to appreciate that.\n\n5. People.  To quote Tommy Lee Jones' character Kay \"A person is smart. People are dumb, panicky dangerous animals and you know it.\"  While I don't necessarily agree that this is always the case (and I don't think revealing aliens would cause that much issue), almost all our problems stem from people being dumb, panicky, dangerous animals.  While I'm fond of people, as a species we've got some major shortcomings that nobody appears to either able or willing (or both) to address.
