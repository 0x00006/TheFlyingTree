My friend drew an explaination:  \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/jPbzpl5.jpg  \n  \nThe triangle thing is called \u2019**Samsa**\u2019, it\u2019s made of pistachio and nuts.  \nThe green ball is a **pistachio ball**. It\u2019s made of pistachio, white chocolate and cranberry filling.  \nThe rhombus shaped thing is called **Makroudh asmar**, it is filled with dates, nuts or almond paste and the dough is made with a combination of semolina and flour, which gives the pastry a very specific texture. (this was my favourite!)  \nThe rhombus shape without the dots on top is called **Sorghum** and made of sorghum.  \nThe sesam roll on the lower right corner is called **Homsia**, it\u2019s made of chickpea flower and sesam and it tastes like a rice crispie cracker and is very crumbly, but I liked it.  \nThe one in the middle in the bottom row is **Baklava**, made of almonds and sweetened with honey. Very sweet and sticky.  \nThe roll in the middle row on the left is called Almond roll and made of almonds.", "is_submitter": true, "distinguished": null, "created_utc": 1630826940.0, "parent_id": "t3_pdvo71", "replies": []}]}
