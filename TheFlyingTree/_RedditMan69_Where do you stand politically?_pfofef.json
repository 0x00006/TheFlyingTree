I mean to say that I recognise even dictatorship can be beneficial to everyone and even democracy can be tyrannical. It all depends on who's in charge, not how they got there. So the method of how they get there really needs to be a way to filter out the bad apples. Reduce the chances government corruption and incompetent leadership. I'm just not sure what that method should be.\n\nAnd when it comes to ideology, I'd say it's in the same boat as policies. Different cultures and different circumstances would influence which ideology would be a good fit for it's people. Some cultures love freedom and choice, other countries love order and hierarchy.
